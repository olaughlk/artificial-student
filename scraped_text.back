Holy fuck. A simple google search just revealed that Philomena gets paid $480,000 a year and is overseeing the dismantling of the school into a quasi-online for-profit model ala Bain Capital style restructuring. A reasonable salary for an executive would be $150,000. We could pay 3 Emeritus level Professors with the excess. What other executives are getting paid this excessively while we are seeing MOTHERFUCKING TUITION HIKES?! Meanwhile, they are forcing professors to take on increased course loads for what essentially amounts to executive profiteering?!!?   


We need to organize.  


The Professors need a union.

&#x200B;

The students need a union.   


DM me your info if you are down with the movement and want to organize!
Just for context, the annual budget is $350M or so.

For some more context, the university is facing a $35M budget deficit as a result of Covid and decreased tuition.
Does this seem out of the ordinary compared to other presidents across the state?

UofM's president makes over $850,000, MSU's president has a base salary $800,000 but can top out at a million with incentives. Many of the private college presidents are probably making a lot more than $480,000 too. Its comparable with what WMU and CMU are paying which seems about right to me.

At $150,000 you probably arent going to be able to attract the kind of person you need to run a school of this size.
Faculty does have a union; its called the University Academic Senate and the Executive Committee of the Senate.

Students do have a union; its called Student Senate.

If anybody want to voice your concerns about tuition, student affairs, or really anything student related PLEASE contact Student Senate [here](https://www.gvsu.edu/studentsenate/cms-contact-index.htm)
The issue is with our many admins there are. I had a Management professor at GV 6ish years ago, very smart guy! He said when he started (80s) that there was a professor to admin ratio of 1:2 or 1:3. He said it's since doubled, and that the admins are getting paid way more. There's the issue.
Yeah fuck this shit paying more for this ambiguous online bullshit fuck them I want more transparency when I’m paying an arm and a leg for an education
I completely disagree. Yes, it’s high, but high salaries show how valuable people are. If Philomena’s salary were lower, then the university would risk losing her to another university with more lucrative pay.
No more unions please
Just because they get away with it doesn't make it right. We can only change our school and can not worry about the compensation packages offered at other schools.

Are you a student? Are you okay with financing this egregious salary?
A Senate is beholden to the whims and interests of the Administration which has proven itself compromised by careerists.
Does the University Academic Senate engage in contract and salary negotiations on behalf of the Professors?
you know you can email the president at president@gvsu.edu and say you want more transparency. I don't think they are getting actual student feedback about this process.
https://mibiz.com/sections/economic-development/gvsu-names-philomena-mantella-as-next-president#:~:text=GVSU%20trustees%20unanimously%20approved%20a,first%2Dyear%20salary%20of%20%24480%2C000.
Just graduated here. 

~500k is not an egregious salary IMO. The president is responsible for the reputation and smooth operations of the entire university. 

You can make $150k a year as a truck driver if you really wanted to. It might sound like a lot to you as an undergrad, but it’s nowhere near high enough to attract the level of talent you need to handle the great responsibilities that come with the job.
Then what’s your plan when admin says “No”? 

These two organizations are created for this exact reason. If there are concerns from either of their respective groups, the senators will work on their behalf.
No, just like Student Senate doesn’t negotiate grades with professors.

It’s the role of the Senates to discuss university policies and to decide what would benefit their constituencies the best.
Nice. You do know you go to one of the most fiscally responsible universities in the country, right?
The president’s salary hasn’t been adjusted for inflation — EVER! 

Ex-President’s are guaranteed to make bank if they want by writing books, giving speeches, and consulting. The salary is totally inconsequential, don’t act like it has any relevance at all.
Actually yeah, potus is a job that isn't meant to pay well. Like at all. That job isn't about the money.
bro what
I'm unfamiliar with this statue. Who is it of? Who made it? when was it constructed?
GVSU FRIENDS!!! 

Hey everyone, as many of you know there is an infuriating confederate monument in Allendale, the home of GVSU's main campus. When a community group organized a protest against it, local politicians called in well-armed white supremacists to defend it. A few of us were at that protest and it was scary - some of the same people involved in storming the state legislature in April were present. GVSU's president weighed in on the issue, but the language was not very forceful, and the Allendale Township Board remains committed to keeping this statue up. The GVSU History Dept recently approved a much stronger statement calling for the removal of the statue, and in the hopes of putting pressure on both GVSU and Allendale, we would love to share it more widely. If you are connected to GVSU as a student, staff, or faculty member, you can help us do this! Go to the link below and you can sign the statement in support of the department. GVSU as an institution is committed to equity and inclusion, and it should take a clear stand on Allendale's confederate monument.
I found this article: https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2020/06/confederate-soldier-statue-likely-to-stay-in-west-michigan-veterans-display.html

I think it's interesting that this petition says nothing about a Union soldier also being depicted, and that this statue is part of Veterans 
Garden. I think it's important for us to remember why we fought the Civil war -- let's not forget that the good guys won! I think this petition is a giant waste of time. This statue is in no way glorifying  white supremacy -- it's recognizing that we fought a war to advance human rights. How about you organize to make our community a better place instead of being professionally offended by anything that's triggering.
Where is this statue located? I’ve never seen it before.
I’ll sign just based on historical inaccuracies.
Actually extremely disappointing to hear the history department is falling for this stuff.
so you’re telling me that local politicians informally or formally asked racist people with guns to come to a college campus and stand around a statue that people were protesting for it to be taken down...?
It's in the Veterans Garden and also depicts a Union Soldier. This petition feels like virtue signaling to me. "These monuments were put in place by groups like the United Daughters of the Confederacy to inscribe in public spaces their conviction that white supremacy..." NO! This is a statue of American soldiers in THE VETERANS GARDEN where it belongs. There's no message here of white supremacy. Only a history lesson that life is really hard and that the North cared enough about our African brothers and sisters to go to war to fight for their rights. Tearing it down would be a signal that we shouldn't remember this fight for justice and human rights.
Thank you
So you believe you are more knowledgeable about American history and it’s context than the History Department? Nice.
No OP is outraged because that's the cool thing to do these days. Imagine if we used this energy to actually bring people together to affect real durable positive change, like community gardens, public health initiatives or Women's center fund raisers. This is such monumental BS that i want to build a giant Turd statue to honor all the Social Justice Warriors who want to see symbolic change that doesn't do anything to benefit those who are actually disenfranchised
That Confederate statue is in Allendale at the township Park off of 68th Ave.
Slavery was one of the triggers of the Civil War?
I read a few articles about this and it’s definitely not virtue signaling. Let’s evaluate the statue. Before we do that, we need to address the quote you pulled from the petition. That quote was put there to give context to the initial proliferation of confederate statues in this country and why there were erected. This petition is in no, shape, or form claiming the United Daughters of the Confederacy put these statues here, just that they were the first group to erect them en masse. The United Daughters of the Confederacy has been widely accused of promoting white supremacy and white-washing history for a long time. If someone disagrees with that, prove otherwise. 

For the statue, it depicts a Confederate soldier and a Union soldier standing with their back against each other (in a protective position)over a slave boy holding a sign that reads “Freedom to Slaves” dated January 5, 1863. Firstly, why are they depicting two COMBATANT soldiers defending the same thing? The Union and Confederacy fought largely over the continuance of slavery, with one group (the Confederacy) leaving the country/attacking the other group in effort to continue the practice of chattel slavery. 

Secondly, the date on the paper the slave is holding is at best, historical inaccurate and at worse, white-washing. Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation on 01/01/1863 and the last slaves weren’t freed until 06/19/1865. So why the date chosen? On 01/05/1863, Jefferson Davis (Confederate President) said : 
“May God prosper our cause and may we live to give to our children untarnished the rich inheritance which our fathers gave to us.” 
“Our cause” was fighting to persevere slavery. Yet, the statue has him protecting a slave. 

This statue is not accurate depiction of the Civil War at all. This statue paints the picture they were both fighting to free the slaves when in reality, one side started a war to keep slavery and the other fought back to reunite as a country. I haven’t heard about this statue at all until I saw this post, but holy shit its intellectual dishonest. They should haven taken this down based on that. Funny how the argument was to ‘remember our history’. I would agree to keep it up it actually portrayed reality, but this statue serves as propaganda to Confederates.
No way in hell this is virtue signaling. They appear incredibly passionate about this and it's come up multiple times in the 6 years I've been around gvsu. Plus what would the point of them just virtue signaling be? They definitly want it done and it's not like it's backed by some buissness, which is the easiest way to spot virtue signaling

Whether it makes sense or not idk I never felt the need to look into it more
I think it's outright stupid to encourage the erasure of history.
i will second building a giant turd statue.
Maybe you should rewrite the petition. If there's nuance and incorrect political context, it's certainly not outlined in what's written.
The only historical aspect of this statue is that it is a statue lol

Edit for grammer
It’s not mine. I saw it here like everyone else. But come on, you know making a statue that depicts a confederate soldier defending a slave to allow him to be free is straight bullshit.
Grammar aside, by your logic you can say that about all forms of art.
We’re talking about statues accurately representing historical events. This statue does not accurately represent historical events. Dont move goalposts.
How so?
Basically the title. I see snapchat stories all the time of packed rooms filled with maskless people and people vacationing without quarantining when they return. Then they insist on getting in my personal space in line at the dining halls and bus stops and I am honestly really scared. Nobody is taking this seriously and I don’t want to have to face the consequences. I already take every precaution I can, I am not going home for the holidays or going on vacation, I wear masks in social situations and in public spaces. I am just tired of everyone else bringing the new variants into this campus when we are so close to being vaccinated.
Just sign up to get vaccinated is about all you can do.
you can report them to the university. there’s a webpage somewhere where you can report student conduct violations, and violating covid guidelines is “student endangerment”. i’m sure the punishments vary, but at least something will be done :/
If I were you and I saw a party on a snapchat story, I would try to find their location via snap map (if they have their location on) and snitch snitch snitch. These adult children have it coming to them
I would go ahead and file a report with the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution (OSCCR). They can take action. Only problem is you have to know names of those violating the protocol. 

https://www.gvsu.edu/osccr/file-a-report-22.htm
Wow lol
Youre right. I don’t understand the selfishness of these people.
Agreed. I’d be the biggest snitch on the goddamn planet.
https://imgur.com/a/wQXtpc2
This is just one of several parties ive seen on snapchat. They are all crowded in what looks like one of the dorm rooms/bedrooms.
ikr this sub is a joke
Cry about it
I'm right there with you. It's so obnoxious seeing all these people being so irresponsible.  But yeah unfortunately given the school's response to the uptick in cases being "hey maybe think about not doing whatever you're doing" I doubt they'll actually do too much about it. Hope you stay safe out there and get poked when you can
People like u and op are the ones “crying about it”. It’s honestly ridiculous that people are still thinking like this with a vaccine and the knowledge we have abt the virus..

How would it be effective to report somebody for essentially doing the same things that take place in bars and restaurants in GR?
We are still in the early stages of getting a vaccine rolled out. Cases are rising quite a bit. Variants are spreading. This is absolutely not what’s going on in most bars and restaurants, and if it is, they’re typically reported for it. Don’t use the vaccine existing as an excuse for this. There’s a lot more that needs to happen, even if you yourself have it.
I never understood the infatuation with the president of the university. He's just an old man.
The president we had before T.Hass sucked. When T.Hass became president he used to sub classes, and sometimes serve food at Fresh and was just an all around cool guy. I have worked at and gone to several universities since and none of them have been as friendly or well liked as T.Hass 
He also has way less influence in university and academic affairs than people think he does - He's really just a figurehead. 

I've never been a huge supporter of him and I think he's really holding the university back in some ways (pandering to big donors, allowing our athletic programs to crumble under the purview of a nepotistic athletic director, allowing too much corporate influence on campus, etc)   

That personal phone call to The Lanthorn exec editor a year or two ago was the last straw IMO 
Well yea its cool to appreciate a nice guy, but people flip shit when they see him. I don't get that.
How many university presidents do you know?
because that is the closest the majority of campus will ever get to someone even sort of remotely famous/popular. I mean, everyone needs something to get excited for.
You guys act like there wasn’t an option to take online classes, you made the choice to come to campus and if you didn’t weigh the risks of that it’s 100% on you. It was obvious from the start there was gonna be some covid on and around campus and our cases were about what most who did think about it were expecting. Me and my flatmates can’t learn online and that’s why we’re here, don’t try to take that from us just because you can’t think things through.
Hi, I'm a senior, I have a very specific set of classes I have to take this year. One of them had no online option. Go ahead and assume that we all had a choice if that's what makes you feel better though. It's valid that you don't want all online classes for the reason you stated but how about you don't come in here and make accusations about people whose circumstances you know nothing about.
Lol you act like the students are the ones deciding if we go full online
Whether some courses did or did not offer an online option every single person still made the CHOICE to take classes this semester. For those that will be quick to respond with "but my major...", "but as a <fill in the blank> student..", etc you still made the choice.

Is there a potential for setbacks if someone makes the choice to not take classes this semester? Absolutely. 

The hard reality is that every single person (whether they want to admit it or not) weighed the decision to take in-person classes against the risk of contracting covid.
Oh no ARealOpossum, didn't you hear, that kind of logical thinking isn't allowed around here.

Fortunately though, this sub is just a giant circle jerk and a minority opinion, so I wouldn't worry about losing your in person classes.
I dont think you understand the reality of what happens if students dont decide to take classes for a semester. If students, like me, have loans of any kind you have to start making payments back into them if you arent in school for a set amount of time. For a lot of students going into repayment isnt financially optionally for them right now so they have no choice but to continue schooling.
I’m a freshman this year and the GVSU subreddit seemed really cool until I realized half of it is just people shitting on GVSU for how they’ve handled COVID.
Is that what the financial aid office explained when you talked with them about the concern of student loan repayment if you choose to not take classes this semester?

I would find it odd they wouldn't inform you of the six month grace period from when you are no longer enrolled for six credits or more, or about deferment and forbearance options that are available due to financial hardship.

At a minimum they should have at least informed you about the extension of the Student Loan Payment Relief until Dec 31, 2020 which ceases all student loan payments and waives all interest on student loans.

Are you sure you spoke with an actual financial aid counselor and not a student worker?
Hmmm maybe we should have kept the fucking megathread? Ive been saying for weeks this sub has become nothing but shitting on gvsu for covid and we should be keeping it in one thread.
As an atheist, this is good news. Everyone should have religious freedom and their place they had to pray before is not as silent and up to date as the Christian one.
I fail to see why this is a step in the wrong direction.
I hope this construction seriously doesn't mean "construction". Why can't other religions use Cook-DeWitt? I'm pretty sure that there only needs to be one religious building on the campus of a public university, no matter which religion it's for.
Cook DeWitt isn't owned by GVSU though. The owners just "allow" it to be used; which is also why people can rent it for weddings and stuff like that.I think the entire thing is stupid though. Religion is often a notion tossed around when someone wants votes, and its pretty obvious in this case. Not to be a dick but I dont think the university should be paying for anything like this. If there's a large backing for it, someone needs to put their money where their mouth is and fund it themselves (like the trust founders who paid for cook DeWitt) and not expect the student body to do it for them
Throughout history, religion has always been anti-science, anti-progress, anti-human rights, etc... 

It really pains we to see a university (which stands for science, human rights, progress, etc) devote more space for this type of stuff. 
OP is an Atheist, and creating a safe space for religious people somehow infringes on his rights.
It disregards the separation of church and state. 
It may be that the physical facilities just simply can't accommodate two different religions like Catholicism (think: lots of space needed for sacristy, vestments, etc.) and Islam -- not out of tolerance but just out of physical space. 
It's hard to say from the article what sort of construction there will be. It sounds like they will just be finding a place within a current facility. Regardless, all religions should have a place to do whatever not just Christians otherwise it perpetuates our already enclosed community.
Probably just a remodel of an existing space to make it quiet. Probably we are not talking about a new building like a prayer chapel. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_and_science
Oh I thought it was operated by GVSU. I was thinking they were just promoting one religion over another, but that's obviously not the case. I see what you're saying now. I agree 100%.
I don't know why everyone is down voting you so much...
Either that or he/she thinks it disregards the separation of church and state, which it does. 
No it doesn't. It provides a safe and appropriate environment for the practicing of faith if one chooses to do so. By no means does supporting diversity and providing students with a place to exercise their freedom of religion disregard separation of church and state.
I think it's more of the fact that Cook-DeWitt is clearly designed for Judeo-Christian religions more than anything else. 

Other religions see this, and know that if they make enough noise about the issue, they'll get a space that's more closely designed for them. 

They know that the university won't push back on it because the institution wants to be seen as a diverse, inclusive community. 

The university is sort of backed in to a corner on this.
I don't disagree with that first statement necessarily because I believe in separation of church and state. But that second statement is not factually correct. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_and_science
I agree! However, there's not going to /be/ zero religious buildings on campus, so we should at least only have one.
I feel like there's gonna be picketing or some shit by the Judeo-Christian groups if we make them share, but I feel like there should be. People should be made aware how ridiculous this situation is. My roommate is a satanist, should we be fighting for her to have a religious building?

No. It doesn't matter.
They use some vague wording, but it's owned by an "independent trust"...likely through a subsidiary of the Cook family(?). 

The whole thing seems a bit suspicious. 

* As a facility located on campus but not "owned" by the university, you would think that this trust would then be paying royalties to the university for land use, property tax, etc. This may or may not be the case. 

* When people rent this facility for weddings (etc) or when student organizations rent the space for meetings (as I have done before), all of the rental process is done through the university AND the invoice to pay for using the space is addresses from AND payable to the university, not an independent trust. 

* Cook-Dewitt is very clearly designed as a prayer chapel, there's no arguing that. The simple fact that an obvious prayer chapel was allowed to be built on the campus of what's supposed to be a progressive, scientific university is a bit strange. 

Very suspicious. 

Conclusion: The university, as usual, is pandering to the hyper-conservative ideals of some of their largest donors.
You're likely right, but I don't think that public/university funds should be used for a) building b) maintaining or c) cleaning this space. 
We have a very conservative student body, and it sometimes fails to see how issues on campus influence the broader higher education community. 
What do we do, then, when that separation of Church and State conflicts with the 1st Amendment right to practice any religion?  It's clear that practicing on campus is extremely inconvenient.
Who pays for: 

* Building the space? 

* Stocking the space? 

* Maintaining the space?

* Cleaning the space?

In all likelihood, the answer to the above questions is the university, hence the problem. 
We could go back and forth on church-sponsored book burnings, oppression, and the perpetuation of beliefs that have been proven scientifically inaccurate/unlikely all day, but we both know where we stand on that and neither of us will budge as the result of a simple internet discussion. 

I'll only say one thing about it: There was a time period when religion and the church were heavily intertwined with government and public institutions. This time period is/was called the "Dark Age(s)" for a reason.

Anyway, this particular student senate resolution being discussed will have no effect on students of the Catholic faith. 

Students of the Catholic faith and other Judeo-Christian religions use the Cook-Dewitt center for their religious needs, and the Cook-Dewitt center is not part of the university. 

This new space is for use by the ~10% of students at our university who identify as being of a religion other than Judeo-Christianity (e.g. Muslim students, Hindu students, Buddhist students, etc)...and this new space will be part of the university. 

This whole thing isn't an issue of the religious vs the non-religious, this is an issue of the separation of church and state.   
Cook-Dewitt is not owned by the university.
It's nice to see they embrace the idea of equality of religion at least, but I don't think it would make sense to have the university build a religious building, nor do I think it was right to have the Cook-Dewitt center built on campus if it was going to be entirely based on Christian religions.
FWIW, I have absolutely no problem with the university providing equitably to accommodate people of any religion, or or no religion at all. In fact I would suspect that the university is legally obligated to provide equitable accommodations for all, if GVSU is going to provide for any one religion at all. That last "if" is the point of contention, and I will leave that for better minds to discuss. 
Then why is it there? Is it like how Grand River Aseptic is run through the university?
Most of GVSU's big name donors are very conservative and religious. 

The university likely allowed the Cook-Dewitt Center to be built on campus to keep the aforementioned donors happy.

Grand River Aseptic pays the university to use their space. That company was already located there when the university purchased the land, and the university doesn't plan on using that land in the near future, so they allowed the company to stay as long as they pay royalties to the university. 

When the university decides to develop that space, Grand River Aseptic will be kicked-out. 
okay. That makes sense. Why is GRA through our phone system, though? I'm a switchboard operator and get calls all the time for them.

We've been seeing a lot of simple question threads the last few days, so rather than spam the sub with individual threads, ask your questions here and feel free to answer any questions you know.

If you want to post about COVID-19 updates or changes at GVSU, please also post them here. **Don't post a new thread.** All COVID-19 questions/rants/etc. threads will be removed.

not sure this thread is necessary. this isnt that big of a sub where it gets flooded with questions daily. kinda just seems like an effort to make the covid posts less noticeable.
Relegating what's possibly the biggest point of concern for college students this year to one thread is absolutely stupid
All of my friends and I were exposed to someone with Covid. We all got tested on wednesday and still have not heard anything back. We all signed up for the myChart thing, but is there anything else we’re supposed to do? Seems kind of pointless to get tested here at GV if the turnaround time for results is 3+ days.

Edit: Just called the hotline, and they said i should have my results in 3-5 DAYS FROM NOW. Do they not realize how dangerous that is? There is almost no point in wasting your time getting tested here if your results could take up to a week to come in.
Check the last two weeks of posts, we’ve gotten a lot of common, one-question threads. Better to consolidate them than flood the sub.
If you have other ideas, please send them to the mods. 

As I see it, this sub doesn’t need daily updates as threads about the number of cases or questions about testing. Consolidating common questions removes a lot of unnecessary, one question threads (which we’ve seen quite a bit over the last two weeks).
I quarantined for five days before I got results and that was in July when they weren't processing GV tests.
Then do a faq and lock threads if the q is on there. Don't just kill all discussion on the topic. Any time a thread like this is made, it just kills any relevant discussion on it
I think a better idea would maybe be to make a “frequently asked questions” sticky at the top of the page, with things like a link to register for spectrum MyChart and a link to the GV COVID-19 dashboard, etc. 

That way, new posts can still be made, but the number of one liner repeat questions can decrease. 

I’m a little annoyed about the same question being asked on repeat, but I did really like the post from the student this morning (?) about the Harvard health COVID tipping-point model, and I like seeing other posts like it. It’s a shame that comments on that post were locked. 

Just food for thought.
yeah i understand that, and I have been. I’m just saying it’s dangerous because i’m sure there’s a lot of people here who aren’t like me and won’t quarantine until they see they’ve tested positive; by that point they’ve likely already infected many others.
Register email, open mailer, and you are entered in that week's drawing. Good luck! http://www.taylorkole.com/say-hello
I was there and had an interesting time during the Q&A section
I was 7
Good... For you? 
In my time here at GVSU I have seen NDT and John Kasich, one of those was a good time.
I remember talking to someone recently about how they talked to him when he visited, but I can't remember who. I think it was one of the on-air talents at WGHN in Grand Haven (I was an intern there, I worked with them a lot). 

Also, fun fact: apparently the Nuge rode his motorcycle through my old highschool way back.

I must be missing what I'm searching for 
The woman in the bottom right is frequent used as a "sheltered freshman" meme. 
I mean, he did break the law.
I suppose it depends on what was in the emails they were sending.
Someone high-up got egg on their face, so naturally they're taking it to extremes. It's absolutely an over-reaction, but it's not a surprise.
You're not wrong, and I agree with you, but I still am taken aback by it a little every time friends and I talk about it. I don't view emails in general the same as the law does, so when someone sends prank emails or something like that, I take it as a joke, never thinking that guy just broke the law even though, as you said, he did.
Everywhere in Allendale has inflated prices. Just drive to Meijer in Standale if you have the time. In a pinch that store by BK does the job though. The one by the Meadows is really pricy imo.
Liquor store by bk sells at state minimum.
Meijer in Standale. 
There are no "deals" on alcohol because the prices are state regulated. Michigan assigns each product a "state minimum shelf price" aka the lowest price a retailer is legally allowed to sell it for. 

All neighborhood stores will most likely upcharge $1-3 on the state minimum. D&W/Family Fare and Meijer both have state min prices because they don't need to make a profit on those products.
I always went to the one by bk and jj. I always had great service and the prices aren't so bad. But for the cheapest mejier is your best bet. 
Not drinking saves a lot of money.
Sam is a cheapskate and all of his beer and food are expired lol
So does not going to college, yet here we are... 
When I would go in there to buy an Arnold Palmer (99¢) I would give him a dollar and he would be like, "I keep penny." And I'm thinking no dude that's not how it works. You offer the penny and then I say, "No that's okay you can keep it." In all seriousness though it's a good place if you need something quick but you will absolutely spend more than needed.
I worked there for a year and it was the worst place I've ever been(and I spent two years at McDonald's). Everything is over priced and/or expired, he acts buddy buddy with people then talks shit as soon as they leave, and he creeps on girls with his dozen security cameras. 
He is a real bro when he gives you a condom for the night, but its also really really weird.
wait, is Sam the old Indian guy?
He's so cheap that he doesn't even like to give out bags for you to carry your items in. Dude is unbelievable.  
That's only a dilemma if you choose a major that won't allow your investment to pay off.

My Response...

>Grand Valley State University is a public university and should formally observe the holidays that are dictated by our governing body. While I completely respect the views of people from all demographics on campus, it is a lot to ask of the student body to observe a holiday practiced by a small minority. The beauty of religious freedom is that an individual can observe their faith independently. Why are the beliefs of the tiny majority being forced upon the entire student body? To add, Rosh Hashanah starts at dusk the evening prior to the start date of the holiday. Could these students make accommodations to leave early instead of making everyone else accommodate to them? These questions and concerns place serious doubt on whether or not this situation was handled appropriately. In addition, rescheduling this event sets a new precedent >going forth for groups on campus to take issue with the scheduling of campus wide events.

I don't think you have a good argument that your membership will be lower because it's on a Saturday instead of a Sunday. In fact I could argue that more people will attend CLN on a Saturday night because many people are all working on their homework Sunday night.

I also don't understand why it's such a large deal in the first place but to each their own.
This disappoints me because I work Saturday night and as a transfer was really looking forward to checking our the various clubs.
Half of my eboard won't be there. The other half doesn't want to be there (commitments they would have to now break). This Saturday is a pretty busy day for a lot of people. I doubt it will be shoulder to shoulder like it has. I hope I'm wrong though.
My club is in a similar situation as the weekends are when we do all our trips and activities. It's also pretty common for freshman and students in general to go home on weekends. I heard far less complaints from people when event got moved to Sunday.

Stay classy, /r/GVSU.

OK i am currently a freshman at GVSU and am in the engineering college. The classes i am taking are math 201 (calc), WRT 150, CHM 115, and EGR 106. these tips are mostly for getting through EGR and will not help you much if you're already in the class and struggling.

tip 1): take a programming class! i recommend learning C++, my senior year of highschool i took a C++ programming class and it is very similar to the Arduino C that you will absolutely have to learn to get through his class! the problem that most people i know have with learning programming in this class is learning the logic of it. programming logic is something that is somewhat hard to learn, but after you do everything is MUCH easier. and if you dont have the ability to take a programming class in highschool, then you should get a debugging program (recommend codeblocks with a C++ compiler) and learn some programming over the summer. if you're going to learn yourself, then start with flow charts! this is important! the flowcharts help you understand the logic of how the program works.

tip 2): get a CAD program, and mess around. in EGR 106 you have to learn how to use the CAD program solidworks, now its hard to get this program because it's expensive so i suggest getting the next best thing: Autodesk Inventor. both software use the same methods to create 3D objects the main differences being the placement of buttons on the GUI. 

tip 3): if you do, or dont follow those tips above and find yourself having trouble what you need to do is make friends with people in the class. it can be hard to understand the material depending on how the professors present it, therefore the best thing you can do other than asking the professor (because it's hard to get to downtown offices hours as a freshman) is to ask your friends! organize meetings where you can all get together and do some homework/ projects if you get a big enough group someone is bound to understand it. if no one understands the programming, or you cant find anyone who does, then another thing you could do is as someone who is going into computer sciences, most CIS majors that i know have had highschool programming classes, and/or tried programming at home, they can help a lot!

this tips come from me, a person currently in the class who is having a much easier time than most of my friends in the class. 

PS: if you are currently in the class and having trouble with programming i can help, just send me a message and i can either try to explain some of it to you, or if my group of friends decides to meet to work on stuff i can invite you to it.
You're not in the engineering college yet mate, you have to apply for it. You're just taking engineering classes. That said. Make tons of friends. Anyone that can help you with a program or design is incredibly useful. First year is mainly about learning the basics and then a touch on the design aspect. I'm in my second year and I've changed from a bsee major to physics. But If you need any help or ideas pm man :) hope it works out for you. 
Tip 3 is pretty solid advice no matter what major you are choosing. 

Also, I agree with the comment about C++ and C, but for people who are _just_ starting out with programming, I'd recommend a more forgiving language like maybe Python or even R. Start simple, learn generic programming concepts and then make the leap to C/C++. 
Seconding the offer for help, I'm taking 106 right now and I've seen a ton of people in my class struggle with Arduino C. TBH I feel like not nearly enough time was spent in our class on coding, and people who were starting fresh got left behind real quick. I've got some prior experience with C and C++, and Arduino C is really just like a baby's-first flavor of C. So yeah hit me up if you've got trouble with it, I'll try to help you out!
Here's my advice: if you can't learn the concepts as they're introduced in the first semester of engineering, you may need to reconsider your major. It only gets harder as you go on. You're also only in one engineering class right now. You will never have that few ever again. 

Be careful giving advice as a first semester student. Let those kids who are struggling switch to another major before they invest more time in a program that only gets harder. 

Tip 3 is golden, though. Have at least a few people's numbers for late night homework questions. 
Engineering aside, I recommend that **everyone** take a programming course in high school. It's such an invaluable skill to have and the logical processes behind it will come in hand in countless situations down the road. 
Ya I see freshmen make the "college of" mistake all the time. Its especially true with engineering and medicine since they're competitive as fuck and there's a big chance of getting denied. 
i'd beg the differ, i did not apply to GVSU as most other people did, i applied to the GVSU engineering college, and on my path it even says that i am in the "Padnos Col of Egr & Computing" on my path. Additionally when they gave us our RFID entry cards they said "you will keep these with you until you graduate from, or drop out of the engineering college."
I have no idea why you are being downvoted on this, because you are absolutely right. 
yeah, you go to GVSU until you get accepted.
Same here,  accept I am in CS.  The admittance they're talking about is the second admit once you get your core done.
Wtf is this writing style 


Someone sign this girl up for some writing courses please.. This is brutal 
Why is the Odyssey a thing now? What does it even try to do?
No idea. It's like localized Buzzfeed.
It's so shitty, too. At least the Black Sheep has some good, original content.
Let's be honest, they're both incredibly mediocre. 
The Odyssey feels like a tumblr blog though lol.  
GVSU taking biased incidents seriously is one of the reasons I like the school. I also feel that professors shouldn't make stereotypical comments that make students feel uncomfortable. 

Both of their red flags seem to be good things to me. This isn't a state that people can be born into, this is a educational institution that people join willingly.
I think these red flags are only "limiting" if/when applied in overly sensitive cases. For example, if a student were to get a boatload of homework and therefore deem the situation as "lame", technically this could be reported as offensive as the term is 'able-ist'.

Otherwise I don't see these as particularly big threats to my free speech.
Is it nonsensical to have policies limiting bias and hate speech? If you're concerned about not publicly being able to be a racist asshole, then find a different college, bud.
Also, the supreme court's current status on free speech [here](http://www.uscourts.gov/EducationalResources/ClassroomActivities/FirstAmendment/WhatDoesFreeSpeechMean.aspx) states that 
>To incite actions that would harm others (e.g. “[S]hout[ing] ‘fire’ in a crowded theater.”).

is not considered free speech. I would say that words based on the criteria of a bias incident using language could be considered and action that has the potential to cause a considerable amount of harm.
Come on. They're weren't threatened with arrest for passing out the constitution. They were nearly arrested because they didn't follow the proper procedures to use the free speech zone. These are not the same things. 
One day old account and all it's posted is links to this article in multiple subreddits including t_d
A couple things strike me as funny about this video and situation in general.

1. The offender is talking in circular logic. He is being told directly what he can and can't do and is being asked questions, but is just repeating the same line.

2. This confrontation apparently last for quite a while (1+ hours), why is there only 2 minutes of highly cropped footage.

3. The officer asks, "Your making a movie right?" The footage is then cropped to remove anything further on that subject. That part is especially funny, because the GVSU Dept. of Communications has an entire process you need to go through in order to record anything on campus. Sure that can't really be enforced if you're not a student, but if you ARE a student, I imagine there are a couple things they could do.

4. These "Orwellian" free speech policies are hardly that. The approval process appears to be lenient (having been screamed at by conservative loons about burning in hell for eternity), so the vetting process appears to be less about controlling speech, and more so about making sure no one is advocating for school shootings or something insane like that.

5. I actually believe the two free speech zones are for the best, with maybe the addition of a third one downtown. ".03% of campus" may be a fair estimate of land actually owned by Grand Valley, but those two spots are the #1 and #2 most trafficked areas. What percentage of students walks through these areas. In addition, if I'm a stressed out student just trying to pass my classes, maybe, just maybe, I don't want to have political, social, economic, and religious philosophies being screamed at me everywhere I go.

6. No one cares about your anecdotal evidence. "I saw a liberal march, so its biased." Well, I haven't seen a liberal march, so as far as I can tell, its not biased. There problem solved. Get some actual documentation of this stuff if you expect me to care.
 
In the end, this whole lawsuit is garbage. No one is going to support you if it makes them feel like your wasting university time and money, and thus their own time and money. If you want the university to change set up a large scale protest. Social media is a hell of a thing; college students are way more interested in political activism than litigation.

Also, /u/jozefbem is an obvious shill account. "Patriotic students threatened with arrest for handing out pocket constitutions at GVSU" posted to the donald? Please, this whole incident gave off a sovereign citizen vibe.

In addition, if you REALLY want a good chuckle, venture down into the comment section of the article for a good laugh.

"I would have forced the cops to arrest me and Trespass me from College that I am paying for... Watch them try to explain that trick to a Federal Judge."

I agree. I'd pay big bucks to watch that play out.

"Socialism is/has taken over the educational system. You need to get permission to do everything from the politburo. Your rights and liberties are a thing of the past."

I forgot the part where a socio-economic system was directly related to concepts of free speech and constitutional rights.
The officer and the policies he's explained seem very reasonable. Seems like these students are making mountains out of mole hills
Yes they were.  GVSU constantly let liberal groups on campus protest outside of free speech zones to their hearts content.  They have arrested / threatened to arrest people who do not adhere to their agenda. 

The school should try following the rules - like the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
You'll eat your words when GVSU loses the suit in federal court.
Being threatened with arrest for exercising your rights is "making mountains out of mole hills?"
For the sake of argument let's pretend that what you're saying is accurate. You're entire argument here is that two wrongs make a right? Those people who I don't like broke a rule so I get too as well is just a silly argument to make. 
They were not following the policies. It's not abnormal to have free speech zones and limits on solicitation, especially on a campus. There's a point when it becomes trespassing. 
Has anyone ever taken Microbiology, BMS 212, with Derek Thomas? Or possibly Microbiology in general at GV, as I'm sure all their finals are similar. Any pointers or things to focus on for the final? Did they curve the grade at all in the end? I need all the help I can get! 

Thanks GV redditors! And good luck on your finals. 
I had BMS 212 with Thomas last year during the winter semester (so, exactly a year ago). 

As I recall, the final was ~130 MC questions (which seemed INSANE because we only have 110 minutes--I hope that he realized his mistake in that). It was about 2/3 stuff from the unit we had just learned, and then 1/3 cumulative. I remember feeling disappointed because I spent a fair amount of time learning every detail of every virus, and there weren't that many virus questions on there (a big chunk of our last unit was viruses). The cumulative questions were not exact questions from previous exams, but were similar. There were not many questions from the first exam unit. I also think there may have been a few extra credit questions, but could be getting it confused with another exam. 

I can't remember if he curved the final grades or not. He may have replaced a low normal exam grade with the final exam grade if it was higher. Again, I can't exactly recall. 

It was a difficult exam, but nothing groundbreaking. I found it to be a little bit easier than his normal exams. The format may have changed since then. Pay attention to the study guide I'm sure he gave out--each study guide he gave us was so detailed, he really made it clear what he expected us to know. It's a lot of stuff, but some of it you'll also be learning in other classes (BMS 291, biochem (232 or 461), BIO 355, etc) so if you cement it now it will be like a review later on. Good luck! 
Thanks for the tips! We actually have 150 questions on the test and only 1/3 is from the most recent material. So we'll see how rushed I am during the test. 
Thanks again. 
Hello r/GVSU

My name is Nick Raak and I am running to be re-elected to GVSU Student Senate, and I am asking for your vote. If elected, I promise to:

\- Advocate for better funding for GVSU. With better funding, students can have better access to university resources (like the infamously terrible parking) while avoiding the cost.

\- Increase civic engagement for students. Especially with the 2020 elections coming up, it's important to get better participation among students regardless of their political affiliation. I've already been working on this with [a bill unanimously passed this month](https://www.gvsu.edu/cms4/asset/68CD24DD-C5CE-ACD3-A1C4698B1764F93F/s-20-03__urge_grand_valley_state_university_to_amend_the_class_attendance_policy_to_allow_excused_absences_for_voting.pdf) to urge GVSU to implement an excused absence policy to voting. 

\- Keep the university accountable to the students. It's important to advocate for the entire student body by working with GVSU administration to improve transparency and communication.

If you agree with my platform and want real change for GVSU, vote for me

Students are given 10 votes, so feel free to vote for whoever else you like. Voting ends Sept. 20.

Has anyone noticed some of their online 2020 courses have switched to online. I signed up for in person classes that meet weekly during registration in May and recently noticed that a few of those same courses no longer list in person times but rather online times. Is this an error in the system or on my part, or has GVSU started moving some courses online without notice. Thanks!
Yep we will all know what our new schedules are by the end of July. They’re going to notify us when they’re done making the changes in banner
To allow for proper social distancing in classrooms, they can’t have as large a class as normal, leading to need more hybrid/online courses. They are trying to balance student preferences with proper safety measures.
They started updating banner around the end of June (no warning). I think they're planning on releasing information once the registration hold ends on the 13th.
I registered today and most of the classes are online and some meet on campus on specific dates...
yeah four of my five classes switched to online or hybrid and I only got an email about it for one class over a month ago. The rest I found out about on my own recently.
Right. Didn't realize they were switching courses to online. The registrar said that in person classes would not be affected.
Yeah...I saw that. I didn't realize they were changing the schedule that much though. Thanks
I guess you mileage may vary. Only 2 of my classes got switched. Im waiting for the other shoe to drop though especially with schools like Harvard and MIT going online.
I've been at GVSU for an embarrassingly long time, and I've never had a bad experience with DPS. Sure, sometimes they fail to unlock the building I work in on weekends, but it's usually because they're tied up with something urgent. All of my personal interactions with DPS officers have been polite and professional, so I always wonder what the problem is when I see/hear complaints about DPS like this.
I believe what OP is referring to is the "party patrol" on weekends. 

This "party patrol" is funded with grants from the Michigan Office of Highway Safety and Planning. Their sole purpose is to give kids MIPs. Seriously. The program is called "Get Wasted, Get Busted."
Have that much trouble with them? Care for an explanation?
Multiple MIP recipient reporting in. Yes, they are that bad. DPS/GVPD + Judge Post = very expensive 
Agreed. When I locked my keys in the car, they dispatched an officer to let me in. When she didn't have the proper tools with her, she stayed and made small-talk with me until someone with the right equipment showed up. They let me in and I was on my merry way.
Room for rent at Off Broadway Apartments. Close to downtown, great window view. Windows in living room provide excellent light. Apartment in excellent condition, close to GVSU. Good sized room, walk in closet, carpeted. Water, sewer, trash, parking included in rent. Tenant pays electric, monthly cost is typically $50-70 , stove and heat are electric. You will have 3 roommates. Because it is dorm style there will be new roommates for this new lease term. The lease is 12 months but may be ended early by finding a sub-letter if desired.
If you need an internship for CIS 490/499, or otherwise, I'm interviewing candidates who know ruby or a comparable language for a rails internship at [FoodCircles](http://joinfoodcircles.org).

* internship is unpaid but credit-approved
* The app is built on rails and lets you pay $1+ for a special dish at one of 20 restaurants and give 100% of that to feeding a local child in need (fulfilled through our distribution partner)
* Our stack is based on git, a public GH repo, and linux vps hosting

Contributions will include tracking usage patterns, helping new nonprofits partner with us, letting users send dishes to friends, etc.  Weekly meetups downtown and a crew of volunteers to work alongside.

I work in coordination with CEI and would love to chat if it interests ya.  Thanks to GVSU_Nate for the tip to post up here. Enjoy the snow day and throw a snowball for me!
Anybody that's been through either the CS or IS program at GVSU should not be accepting an un-paid internship. Your skills are valuable and there are plenty of employers that will pay you what you deserve, even as an intern.
I hear ya spares. If there's a better option out there for students still looking, by all means.
Wishing we had the funding for it! Best of luck to all candidates seeking..
It'll break my heart to keep perusing this subreddit but I'll probably keep doing it. It's been a fun 4 years.
Graduating in 4 years is like leaving a party at 10:00.

Me too! Congratulations! :)
Hahaha graduating in 4 years OMG. (I'm just jealous).

I was in a sociology capstone course with some of these guys. They're certainly on the very left wing of the political spectrum, and I argued against a lot of their anarchist perspectives, but they bring up valid points about The Rapid shifting the retirement burden from the corporation to the workers to make up for pension shortfalls of $2.7 million. 

Here's an m-live article about it:

http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2015/10/rapid_bus_pension.html
This video made my head hurt, these guys followed around a group of EXTREME left wing idiots (about 15 people out of a 20,000 student college) for a day and accomplished what? I could go to a tea party rally and create a video that would be just as ridiculous as this one. 
Weird that this is literally the first time Ive heard of this protest on campus 
I thought it was funny how they were going to protest with a bunch of drivers, but no one showed up.  
I actually graduated a couple years ago and spent all of my time at the downtown business school for the last two years of my time at GV. So I didn't have to deal with all the gender study/safe space bs in Allendale. I stumbled across the video and was surprised to find there are full blown communist aligned organizations on campus. Thought I would drop it on the GVSU sub to see what the response would be. This must not be a very lively sub.
it isn't
Boston University Is First To Announce It May Postpone Its Fall Term Until January 2021
https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2020/04/13/boston-university-is-first-to-announce-it-may-postpone-its-fall-term-until-january-2021/
As people start talking about tuition reduction we have to realize that we are lucky that GV is planning to stay open. We also have to realize that GV is a tuition driven school. It received only about 13% of its funding from the state this fiscal year. BU is a private top research university. It has many more options than GV. 

 GV will make it through this time but it will be required to change faster than ever before. To address change we will all need to stay abreast about the moves being made by other institutions, as well as many other variables.
I guess I’ll go for a run 🙃
U can run but u cant hide from it...muahaha
I think this is hilarious that his quote says that "facts don't care about your feelings" when republicans don't care about [facts](https://youtu.be/xnhJWusyj4I) 
It hasn't been approved with the stamp either. So you can actually take these down. It's the physical equivalent to spam.
What is this for? The paper is so vague
I've seen these posters plastered everywhere around campus, and I still only know of Ben Shapiro as some headass that alt-righters beat off to. 
Like you're allowed to have an opinion and you're allowed to present your opinion to an audience, but don't be a goddamn fuck about it.  I saw these flyers taking over a bulletin board in mack the other day
Quote from r/enoughtrumpspam:

> You know, facts doesn't matter, it's about feelings. I feel that white people are oppressed and crime is going up. I just feel it.
Really? I didn't realize that there needed to be an approval stamp on bulletins. I'd seen them before, but that's a pretty neat system.
This is really valuable information, thanks! 
yeah I don't know what's happening either and it doesn't look bad though. I mean it mentions the left but I don't see how he's an idiot?
He speaks at colleges a lot.  An alt-right supporter.  His spiel in a nutshell is that facts invalidate your hurt feelings, and if your feelings are hurt, you clearly don't know facts or do research.  

He basically tells you that if you know facts, you're not entitled to having your feelings hurt.  

In a more modern/social sense: "Blacks commit crime the most crime, here are the stats that show this, so you can't be upset that police give you shit for being black."
If you knew what the alt right actually was or anything about ben, you'd know that he is actually hated by the alt right and despises them as well. They tweet their hatred for him quite often. So, no actually they don't beat off to him. That's weird.
Yeah after so long, they are taken down. They only have a like a 2-3 week period that they can be up even with the stamp.
Actually, if you have ever listened to anything shapiro has said you would know he hates the alt right and the alt right Hates him. He's constantly getting tweeted racist things and threats from alt righters and speaks out against them on a daily basis. Also the rest of your statement doesn't need to be commented on since the first thing you said clearly identifies that you have no idea who ben shapiro is.
he's not alright genius.

he's never said for black's to disregard the fact that we/they're being shot by the police. If anything, he's stating that we wants them to acknowledge their hypocrisy.

lol.

but, i'm sure a jew is loved by the altright /s
When I took Moes for Philosophy of Religion, he constantly talked shit about being an atheist. Phrases such as "So-and-so was an atheist. I always thought they were smarter than that." were common.
Sounds pretty straight forward to me. Moes has a reputation for being an upstanding Catholic, and some of his work involves his religion. The second case seems inappropriate too. It's not really the role of an educator to expouse political or social opinions whether they be conservative or liberal. Granted, conservatives get in trouble for this more than their counterparts (When I was in Lib Arts classes, I heard more political opinions from professors than was welcome), but nobody here is being censored from anything were welcome to say in the first place. 

Both professors will probably get a slap on the wrist if they're tenured like Moes is, and told to keep their opinions in their pocket. 
Less so the silencing of opinions such much as addressing unwarranted discussion in the classroom environment. It is appropriate for students to be upset at professors for irrelevant political/social/religious discussion, just like I would expect students to be upset at their peers if they tried to force their unwarranted opinions into a discussion.
Looking for Stewart Calc, all levels, Multivariable.  Also, Diff Eq, basic Eng like Statics, Basic Electric, and Linear Alg.

Basically these books which are not worth trading in or selling.
All I want to know is the ranking of specified places that were asked in the survey. Thanks and good luck!

Question for Finance majors - Is a D- considered a passing grade for Finance?

I know Accounting major requires a C- or better for accounting courses, but I don’t see anything like that for finance. 

Plz lmk so I know if I can half ass the rest of my finance class this semester to graduate lol. Thanks.
I’ve never heard a D- be passing for anything. 

>	Plz lmk so I know if I can half ass the rest of my finance classes this semester to graduate lol. Thanks.

Wat
D- is definitely not passing lol
I’ve never heard of a D- being passing.
It would be very difficult to find ANY major that considers D to be a passing grade
Wait wait wait. You’ve had a d- for 13 weeks presumably giving more than half-ass effort, and you want to half-ass now? Bust your ass to get a c-
D- isn’t a grade at GVSU. It’s D or F. Source: I’m a prof who enters grades into Banner on the regular.
Definitely would not hire anyone of any major trying to slide by with D- lol
I earned a D- (it happens) in a class and transferred all my classes over to GV without an issue. Not sure if that helps.
If you were attending MSU, or one of the other state universities that allow students to elect P/F after grades are posted with a D being considered a passing grade, you would pass.  GVSU’s administration must not care what most other state universities are doing, or just wants to make more money from students repeating classes and extending their education
Holy judgey in this thread right now. I’ve got a C in the class right now. I’m also taking 18 credits this semester on top of 30+ hours of work a week. I have a job lined up after graduation so what’s the fuss with me wanting to half ass to focus more on my future career (and my 5 other classes). Unreal how quick some of you jump to conclusions. All you did in your reply was judge and arrive at conclusions for no reason. 3.5 Seidman GPA accounting and finance major working every day all 4 years to pay for my classes. Get the fuck out of here telling me to bust my ass - Take your goofy ass elsewhere.
Yeah I got told the same thing when I asked advisor and undergrad program haha oops
Thanks for being the only person to show kindness
Nah I talked to advisors and professors and every person in here is dead wrong. A D is a passing grade at GVSU.
I did make some huge assumptions there lol. I apologize for that. It’s not my place to give unsolicited advice and I hope you’re able to get a passing grade in the class (whatever that may be). 

Also, just tell me to GFMY. You don’t owe me any explanation on whatever your grades may or may not be.
Yeah idk why everyone’s being so negative. They could’ve chose a million different ways to respond. Grades don’t define us character does.
If you chose P/F or credit/no credit at GV with the cutoff date to make this decision 2 weeks into the semester you have to get a C or better to receive credit.  Yes, D is considered passing but would not be if one chose the credit/no credit option.
No need for me to say that to you. It takes a man to admit when he has done something wrong (I struggle with it myself) so you have all my respect. I’m also sorry if my response to you was aggressive.
Yup. And it’s the fact that I’ve been struggling mentally from the nonstop grind this past year has been for me, and all I wanted was to find solace to know if my grade dropped below a C that I would still pass and graduate. This world (and specifically GVSU students) lack decency and character nowadays.
Right. I’m not even concerned about GPA. I’ve got a 3.5 and I could care less bc I have job lined up. I just wanted to make sure I’d still receive credit for the course with a D
Oh I feel ya. Don’t give up though. There’s better days ahead!
I wonder what were they arrested for? Just having a weapon does not necessarily break any laws.
BB gun lol. 
It sounds like he was wanted for unrelated crimes. 
Connected to the wifi cause it can take up to 72-hours to register my computer apparently. My speeds are all over the place, I'll get 1 mb download with 2 mb upload, re-test my net and end up with 1.7 mb download and 11 mb upload. The fuck is this shit...

*edit*  Whoops, meant mb not gb. 
Use Ethernet, it will be very stable. Also, try using alternative wireless networks, such as GVGuest or eduroam (both will accept your regular school account, but use your full email address for eduroam). The problems you're seeing are from congestion add all students come back to campus. It will improve in a week or two.
Welcome to GV's WiFi. I loved my years there, but not the internet. 
Where can I sign up?! 
Thanks for the suggestion, but even with my ethernet cable my connection fluctuates like crazy. I just hope it evens out by next week...
I assume they were significantly more extreme than before. Last year it was just an old guy with a sign who didnt say much. There is a pretty clear line between free speech and hate speech. Whether or not I'm interested in hearing about repenting my sins its not hate speech and should be allowed. But these stories of the people laughing at suicide, judgement based on how these people look or sexual orientation, and deliberately being rude for no other reason that to get people angry could easily be described at hate speech. 

Its easy to ignore a sign as per the articles suggestion, its hard to ignore a personal attack. 
The account described in the article (assuming it is completely accurate), is not just this religious group exercising its First Amendment right to free speech. This is flat out verbal abuse. There is a moral obligation that GVSU has to protect all of its students from being verbally accosted by roaming bands of religious zealots. Grand Valley should absolutely be doing more to protect students from this Constitutionally protected brand of bullying instead of cowering behind their lawyers.
For those interested, here's a [link](http://www.skepticmoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Brother-Jed-Bingo-Card-1-01.png) to "Brother Jed Bingo" 
There is no line. Hate speech *is* free speech. You don't have to like it, but you can't deny a person's right to speak their mind.
It is. I'm the girl in the article, and all I did was address the students. I told them that the photos Brother Jed was taking are put online to gather donations, and the woman started screaming after me. I tuned her out and kept walking, so I didn't hear a lot of what she said about me, but students came up after me and told me. I guess she got pretty extreme. Someone told me I was thr fourth person she told that they were going to commit suicide. Another girl said the woman told her her over eating was a sin, and I saw another girl standing on the side lines get called a green haired whore. 
Actually you can.
Yeah, there's multiple religious groups that hold signs. If you see a woman waving menstrual pads around and a man taking photos, it's probably brother Jed. 
I really don't understand the hatred for DPS. I've interacted with them numerous times, and they've always been courteous and professional, even when they caught me snooping around somewhere I shouldn't have been. The worst they've ever done by me is fail to unlock the building I work in on weekends.

If somebody has had a bad experience with DPS, there's a good chance that they were doing something stupid and/or illegal.
It isn't a moral argument at all.  Under 21 it is illegal to be intoxicated. ~~A person is considered an open container.~~ Minor in possession. So don't break the law?

Fuck, a few of the cops I knew (and still know) at GVSU hate writing people for pot because they don't think it should be illegal, but they do their jobs. Personally I'm for no drinking age and legalize all drugs, but I respect the officers who do their jobs. They aren't sending a message to drive yourself, they are sending a message 'we do our jobs'.

People, it isn't just youth, have a problem with officers for enforcing the laws that are enacted by the legislature they vote for. Change the law, don't beat up on the people enforcing them because you don't agree with the law. (And I'm not accepting arguments about 'just following orders', these cops are not Nazis.)

Edit: Wrong wording.
Seeing as we will not convince each other I bid you good day on this first night of snowfall in beautiful west Michigan.

Night.
Where the fuck is his helmet???
How many subs did you post this too?
haha... I always ride with one now!
eh... a few. how much is that frowned upon? reddit-beginner here...
My ex boyfriend's cousin took a tumble while snowboarding a couple of years ago. She wasn't wearing a helmet, and her brain exploded and was leaking out of every orifice in her head. Her poor friends that witnessed this. :( I will never not wear a helmet again. 
You're doing fine sport. Gotta get dat karma! 
Very sorry to hear that. I can't imagine taking my board out without my helmet now.
It will probably be available to watch online at a later time. 
Bribery?  Seems to be just an incentive to get more people to help out a cause.  

Besides, you're supposed to eat and drink after donating anyways.  Every blood drive will (or should) have snacks and drinks for after you donate.
This is very common and a great partnership that MI blood has worked out with Papa John's. Having eaten over a dozen blood pizzas myself it has paid off many times.
Lol freshmen
Blood pizzas are the best pizzas

I know. I just thought it was funny how many times they wrote 'pizza' on the form living up to the college stereotype 
This has been going on for many years. It makes sense.
Not sure they are on here. But call up the new chief, she will sit down and talk with you or answer any questions you have. 
If you have any questions, people might be able to help answer them on here.  Some of us may have worked there in the past
Since coming to this university, it's almost like everyone I've come into contact with is strictly conservative. I don't stick with a certain mold of thinking and hold different views on topics, guess I'm just wondering where other people like that are? 


It's western Michigan, what did you expect? Honestly, there are as many liberals are there are righties at GVSU. Maybe you're looking in the wrong places? 
In my time at GV, it's been less of a "Right vs Left" thing and more of a "Wow, I can't believe how ignorant or apathetic everyone is" thing.
Odd, as nearly every person I've come into contact with in one of my gen ed classes was loudly and emphatically liberal about everything.
I attended GV from 06-10. Honestly , it's more apparent freshman year how religious/conservative some people are there. Once you get out of the dorms, you'll find lots of pretty cool, open minded people. I'm honestly not surprised this is still so frequent now; even with the recent popularity of the university.
It's caused by a severe lack of pancake mix amongst religious folk:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwyZ0ji1GRU
Since moving into downtown GR, I have met so many more left minded people from GV. Just an observation
On a county-by-county basis, the [Michigan] county which contributes the most students to GVSU is Kent County (part of the Grand Rapids metro area, and home to the city of Grand Rapids). 

Kent County is a "blue" county, but not by much. It went Obama over Romney in the last election (barely). 

Other counties in the Grand Rapids metropolitan area include Barry County, Montcalm County, and Ottawa County. Depending on who's doing the classification, sometimes Allegan County, Muskegon County, and Ionia County are also included. 

**So, for the Grand Rapids metro area, we have:** 

* **Kent County = Blue** 
* Barry County = Red 
* Montcalm County = Red 
* Ionia County = Red 
* **Muskegon County = Blue** 
* Allegan County = Red 
* Ottawa County = Red 

So, with 5 out of 7 Grand Rapids-area counties "red", you can see why most people think of West Michigan as being conservative. 

*Much of this data is from the 2010 census and/or the 2012 presidential election    

Most people who analyze this data would attribute the "blue" status of Muskegon County as being due to their high minority population. 

Most people who analyze this data would attribute the "blue" status of Kent County as being due to the fact that it's home to the city of Grand Rapids, which means high education levels, a diverse populous, and a young, urban core. 

Now, behind Kent County, the Michigan county that contributes the 2nd most students to GVSU is Oakland County, part of the metro Detroit area. 

According to 2012 presidential election data, Oakland County is also a "blue" county (as all of the other counties in the metro Detroit area: Wayne, Monroe, Macomb, etc...) 

Anyway, what I'm getting at here is that the 2 counties that contribute the most students to GVSU (Kent and Oakland) are both left-leaning counties...so it always surprises me when people think of the GVSU student body as being conservative. 



The stereotype coming to GVSU was that the area was conservative but the school was liberal. What I found when I got here was that the area I grew up in (Livingston County in SE Michigan) was more conservative than the GR area (at least in my experience). Surprisingly, the students that I met from Grand Haven were some of the most liberal people that I met during my freshman year (one was an outspoken socialist).   
It's Grand Rapids, just look at how the area votes. 
GVSU is pretty liberal. 
Lots of religious people.
Its something I never noticed while growing up here. Then I did my undergrad at central and came back for grad and I couldn't believe how crazy people were around here.
I just deleted my original comment halfway through out of apathy. Whoops.
This
It's incredibly subjective. Conservatives will say it's super liberal, and liberals say it's very conservative.

 To be honest though, I do not see the conservative side. There is an LGBT center on campus for crying out loud. There are always movements (occupy the valley for example) and organizations that are aimed to liberals. I guess something is making people call us a conservative campus. Im not seeing the reasoning though. 
My girlfriend has family in Mount Pleasant. Between visiting friends at CMU and visiting her family, I can honestly say that Mt. P is one of the crazier places in Michigan in regard to the people that congregate there. 
anyone going? i kinda need a ride
I think your title is misleading.

Heart damage possibly linked to Covid would be better.

They don’t know what these athletes hearts looked like before Covid.
Hello! Just moved here recently in the fall, and people told me this place was very strict about smoking and drinking does anyone know of any places around Allendale campus to smoke? Thank you so much
Depends on what you’re smoking
Walk off campus and then back on campus
Is GV a smoke free campus now? Or are we talking about Jazz Cabbage?
In the woods is really the only risk free place
Go out on the trail behind GVA
Those basketball courts behind Holton Hooker is an ideal spot to smoke. Used to smoke there all the time as a freshman... I’m assuming you’re talking about weed. 

Otherwise, build a sploof and smoke in your bathroom if ur roommates/suitemates are chill. Did this all the time. 

If the cops come knocking get any paraphernalia out of sight, step out into the hall and do not let them in. They’ll threaten you over and over, but they can’t really do shit.
Just do the towel under the bathroom (if you have a personal one) door trick if you're that worried. Pot smoke doesn't linger anywhere near as bad as cigarettes in the slightest. I used to do it out my window, but I was off the ground and did it quietly so while it did smell outside, no one knew where it was coming from. 

No matter what you do, if you're still worried, take a piece of dryer fabric softener, and use a rubber band to affix it to the end of a paper towel roll, the breathe your smoke out thru that
Drugs r illegal
Was always a big fan of the ole towel under the bathroom door trick, turn on the fan and you'll be Gucci
Towel under the bathroom door doesn't work. And bathroom doesn't work. If there isn't a window then you shouldnt of it in that area if your doing it inside. Ik forsure bc I had a roomates do it, and it had the apartment and everyone else in the apartment's room smelling. So ole bathroom trick does not work in these apartments or dorms.
Ravines, d lot, golf course... But honestly you can smoke any where on campus during the day.  Used to smoke spilfs on the way to class.  In reality GVPD is extremely lenient compared to real police.
Except they aren't anymore.
For the record, GVPD are real police, fully licensed by the state. In fact, they're the most thoroughly trained in Ottawa County. They are the primary law enforcement within the Allendale campus (and the downtown campus during business hours).
On the way to class? U serious? Wow Man U got some balls
Except they are, federal law bud.
Yea but like my post says they're pretty lenient.. especially when  compared to Ottawa.
Just don't act like you're smoking weed and you blend right in.. no one ever even asked for a hit
Lol don't get so salty i'm just stating facts bud, i didn't say anyone gives a shit now did i?
Okbuddy
Who the heck robs college kids? We're all broke. 
What happened was the police department got a new captain. She looks into they laws and GVSU was lagging behind in what they were supposed to be telling students in terms of threats. Thus to bring us up to code with the law we get notified when anything happens. The same crimes that have happened before are happening now and now we are just more aware of the crimes that take place on campus. No need to be any more afraid than you were last year
I was saying almost a month ago that we've had more shit go down so this year than all of last year combined. I bet those emergency buttons start to be put around campus in the next few years.

That being said it was shocking how low it has been in the past, so I'm not sure if that means it didnt exist in the past, or if the school is actually bothering to tell us about it now.
Honestly I think stuff like this has happened before it is just unreported publicly. Look up the reports GVPD has put out of all campus crime and you'd be surprised everything that's happened. And this is only the stuff reported. 

It has always been prevalent it is just the information and notifications of these crimes are now sent publicly. 
Ya, if they took the valuables they'd  just end up with a bunch of old MacBooks and Ugg boots. 
They might not have a lot of cash on hand but near everyone walks around with a pricey computer in their backpacks and an iPhone in their pocket. College kids are not in poverty by any means. 
So what I got from this... We had a captain that didn't follow the law. 
We've had the emergency text/call/email system for ~8 years
Right because gifts aren't a thing and poverty can't happen extremely quickly...
http://media0.giphy.com/media/PS7d4tm1Hq6Sk/giphy.gif
True but it is only now being used much more frequently on things like these robberies as opposed to if there's a tornado in the area.
And the crime reports they post annually were still really low. My mother is health and safety coordinator at UM Flint, she said that this campus was one of the best in the state.
Who's buying them these gifts? Parents. Most college kids have strong support from their parents (most, not all), especially in an area like West Michigan. Poverty is a living situation. Those who are impoverished are surrounded by a complete lack of basic human needs with little hope of getting out. There very well may be students on campus coming from impoverished areas, namely Detroit and Chicago, who see us as easy money. 

What I'm really saying is that we are extremely fortunate to be living and going to school in this area. Don't play yourself down as broke when we are at the top of the food chain. 
Yep. Just because we've had the emergency system, doesn't mean that it was being used to inform students of crimes.

I also think it's worth noting the influx in students over the last four years. Freshmen are being put in off-campus housing. It was a requirement when I was a freshman to live in GVSU freshman housing.
I have said this before and I will say it again, I would rather it be two hours with the facts and investigation straight instead of creating unnecessary hysteria. 
GVSU Pew sits right next to two major pedestrian river crossings between Downtown and the West Side. This funnels people right next to/through campus. Inherently there will be all sorts of people walking through that corridor at all hours of the day. 
Seriously does gvsu need to email you the second someone SUSPECTS someone has a weapon or is being shady?  Let the police do there job and if there's a threat then they'll tell you but seriously chill the fuck out you act like there was someone shooting up the school and they didn't tell you 
GV clearly labeled the message as a timely one. So it's cool.
Update: 

This man has now been arrested: [Link](https://twitter.com/GVSUPolice/status/522813913348714497)

 
With so many students from Detroit who go here I thought you all would be used to randos with guns. Chill the fuck out everybody, it wasn't some Poindexter with a grudge, just some random street thugs. 
Didn't even realize that. Wow. Thanks for the quick update, GV. Glad to know many of my friends could easily have been walking there at that time. 
Jeff you need to change your flair soon, right? :P
If there's ever a potential live shooter situation on campus, every second counts. 

Sure, send out a full, detailed, factual report later...but I think something brief should have been sent out immediately. 
This man has now been arrested: [Link](https://twitter.com/GVSUPolice/status/522813913348714497)

So yeah, he could have been an innocent passerby within his rights to carry a weapon...but he wasn't.

Are you ever gonna change yours? :P
I agree, but the fact this was off campus and probably weren't students it isn't illegal to carry a concealed weapon in the state. This was a matter of informing the masses about what was reported. If the statement was issued immediately those three men who could be doing nothing illegal and fully within their legal rights would have been potential victims of an unnecessary witch hunt. 

However if they started opening fire by all means notify the masses immediately.
Live shooter? I saw "weapon," not "gun."
But don't let the facts get in the way...
Shut up llama
Ya exactly. I read this earlier and I kept waiting for them to list the crimes that he supposedly committed, but obviously there wasn't any.. 



People are acting like having a gun automatically makes him a potential shooter. Might as well start searching cars because I know plenty of kids with their hunting equipment (bows, rifles, etc) in their trunks parked on campus, and they haven't gone on any rampages

Man, you are name-dropping so hard in this thread.  That's what T. Haas said, anyway.

You do realize that was the first time I'd even ever seen the guy
Good idea. Let's just assume he's evil. Who needs cops? Who needs judges and juries? Every non student walking around near GVSU downtown is worthy of suspicion! Arrest 'em all!
Oh, wait... There's that pesky Constitution... You can't just arrest people because they rub you the wrong way. Just because this guy was potentially up to no good doesn't mean they all will be, nor was this guy an "active shooter" or anything of the sort. His proximity to GVSU was merely a coincidence and had no direct connection to GVSU.

I'll have you know I bought my textbooks and only cried for 20 minutes
If you don't buy from the book store you don't get fucked. It isn't that hard to make your money back if you go on Amazon and sell them when you're done with them.

Just remember to buy online way before classes start.
This post is in violation of intergalactic law.
I’m kind of not serious about it but the sections that fit in my schedule are full. This is what I get for changing my major after registration...
Email someone who is teaching psy 300, they're usually pretty flexible with an add. I would probably try to get in with Kurby
I tried to do an override, but it got denied. If emailing could be effective, I’d do it.
That's what I've done in the past. A well written email can go a long way
Awesome, Thanks!
So I'm 25 and applying to begin school in winter 2016. I recently caught misdemeanor charges for driving on suspended license, improper transport of medical marijuana, and false information to an officer. 

I don't want to have to select 'yes' on the question about pending charges, fearing this will ruin my chances. I also don't want to wait until it's resolved, as you never know what'll happen in Judge Post's courtroom. If I get sent to jail or something, I may not be able to apply on time. Obviously, lying isn't a good option either.

Just wondering if you nice people have any stories or knowledge that may help me decide how to handle this. Thanks!

EDIT: Advice and opinions are but appreciated but what I really want is solid information.
You might want to get in touch with Admissions to ask about if/how pending charges might hurt your chances. Give them as much or as little information as you're comfortable with. You could even contact them anonymously if you want.
I like the "Ask the office" advice, but I'd say that if they tell you that it could hurt your chances, you should not apply rather than lie.

If you lie, and they look into it through a routine background check, then you hurt your chances potentially in the long term - or, at least, you have to start jumping through a lot more hoops. Better to not apply, let it resolve, and apply to start in the winter semester or even next year. You're 25, what's the harm in one more semester? If it does resolve, you could spend that time auditing a class or two and develop a routine before it starts to actually count.

If you're honest, and they find out what your charges are, being honest and principled does you credit. It wasn't that long ago that we called it Grass Valley; if a weed charge looks bad to them then _they've lost their soul, man_.

I once was on the outs with GVSU. They gave me a second chance and I did well and graduated; there's good people there. Be honest, my thinking is you'll be fine.
you can not take any financial aid if you are convicted of any drug related charges.
Lying should never be an option. You should know this by now, especially at 25. You've seen first hand where lying has gotten you now.

Be a (wo)man and tell the truth, if it doesn't work out the way you wanted it to, at least you will know you did the right thing. Mark yes. You did the crime and should be held responsible for what arises from it.
if you have a medical card you can escape this charge.
Just lie

I look at job applications all the time and as soon as I see someone has checked the box regarding past felony convictions, it raises a red flag. I would wager that no one checks criminal backgrounds for the thousand of applications they receive. It's more likely that they are looking for people to voluntarily filter themselves out.
That is good advice, thank you.
Thank you very much, buddy. This is the type of answer I was looking for.
I hear you and I get that. I'm looking to evaluate real-world experiences though. People lie at other schools and it works out fine. I'm not saying that's the way I want to go, but I do want all the information available to me. I've looked around and seen lawyers advise varying courses of action depending on circumstances. So that's where I'm coming from.

Also, there's a difference between committing a crime and being charged. You don't know anything about me or my situation, so a generic "do the right thing, see where it got you" lecture isn't helpful. It's frankly condescending. I'm not a POS liar who keeps digging myself a deeper hole. Like I said, this is a question people post on legal boards and get a full spectrum of answers.
This is the worst advice one can give.
HAHA, since when is responsibility a high horse? It's called being a human. You get in trouble, then to try and get out of it, you lie again which causes you get get deepen in trouble, you really think the best thing to do it lie again? I feel bad for your parents because they obviously didn't raise you right.
It's the opposite of your advice, so it's obviously the worst possible choice, right?
Dude, you are being kind of a dick. If OP decides to lie,, couldn't (s)he just apply again once the matter is resolved? One option was waiting until it's over although OP was afraid of the timing. It'd be the same thing. IDK if they blacklist you or something, but if not, it's a "what do you have to lose?" option.

I wouldn't recommend lying, but you're being a giant douchebag about it.

OP, along the lines of "what do you have to lose" I'd say just be open about it and apply again if it doesn't work out. I say don't lie, but it wouldn't be as bad as this person is suggesting.
No, believe it or not there have been many instances where I'm wrong, and I would be the first to admit it. In this case, I'm not. Intentionally lying about felonies (in regards to your post only, not the OP) is stupid and could cause a plethora of issues. Again, I'll repeat, intentionally lying is wrong and should not be the go to answer.
That's why I'm asking. I don't want to waste the $100 ordering my SAT, ACT, and transcripts if it's just a shot in the dark. Should I lose my job over these charges, that $100 thrown away would be a big deal.

Like I said, nobody knows my situation so I'm looking for actual experiences to see how things work. Idk if there is a black list either, so that's the type of stuff I want to find out.

You all are too caught up on lying. I just want information.
Your* grammar could also use some improvement.
As a nearly 30yr old person, you should know that the real world doesn't baby people, especially those who are 25. The OP did wrong, lied, got in more trouble and now wants to lie again to try and conceal truths. You want someone (us) to lie to this person so they make the wrong decision?
I'm pretty into longboarding but I haven't met too many people that actually do it, pm me if you want to go boarding sometime!
Theres a brand new paved road really close to my house in west grand rapids. Its a mile long gradual hill. No rocks, bumps, nothing. Just brand new asphalt. 
It goes from Bridge Street and Covell intersection (There's a 50 bus stop there!) to Bridge street and Mt. Mercy Dr. NW, to Valley Ave. Its the best route i've ever ridden. Traffic is minimal as well. It can get a little speedy sometimes, though.
Only longboarders I see on campus are those mongo pushing flip flop wearing ones
Yes. Come join the LBGT club (Long Board Get Together). Just look up GVSU lonboarding on Facebook.
Casual longborder here :) I've been skating for a couple years but never really got into the bombing hills shit. I've only ever really bombed a couple, i'm more into cruising and carving and stuff. I'd be working on more flatground tricks if i had a kicktail.
Yeah. I like to hit up the crew hill across the road from campus to slide. No traffic at all because it's basically a private drive owned by GVSU. I have a drop deck, a cruiser, a penny, and a skateboard so feel free to pm me if you'd like to cruise, slide, or whatever. 
Oh my, I thought I was the only one who noticed this trend.
That's a confusing title. Also, I'd like to get involved but dont have a facebook.
That is dangerously close to LGBT... I had to reread to make sure I was on the right thread. Sounds sweet!
Check out the loaded ceviche, small, great for cruising and tricks. Wouldn't bomb hills with it though.
I was on the rowing (crew) team at GV. You longboarders are annoying. 
How is it for sliding? I'm considering picking up some gloves and trying that out. I was looking at the cantellated tesseract, its got a nice little kicktail for ollies and stuff
Ok?
Honestly, I have no idea. I'm still learning how to slide. I wouldn't imagine it would do well though. The board is short, and kinda tall for its size.
Good talk
I'm going to GVSU in the fall as a freshman and I was wondering about longboarding? I won't have a car my first semester and I was wondering a couple things:

1. How many people longboard there?
2. Is it acceptable there? or do people get peeved off about it?
3. Is there a campus group of longboarders?

Thank all of you for the help! r/gvsu seems to be the most helpful subreddit around!
Yeah, there are TONS of longboarders here. It's definitely acceptable, there's not like a stereotype against longboarders, it's just a person by person judgment (ie: don't be a dick). 
I'm not a long-boarder, and know quite a few people who dislike long-boarders (myself included) - But don't let others opinions stop you from doing what you want to do. There's nothing inherently wrong with it as long as you're courteous.  
Hey there,  there is a group that long boards (at least there was one last year) , check them out at the campus life night.  They usually meet up for some skating and either head out around campus or go to some hills in the area. They also go to a parking garage downtown often. I went a couple times and they were pretty cool. 

Definitely bring it.  It's fun to skate around campus during free time.
Actually there is a longboard club here! 
http://www.facebook.com/groups/112615362130784/?fref=ts
ALSO: do people ride them to class? if so, do they bring them into class with them or lock them up outside or something?
How did this get downvotes? It was a question. who the fuck would downvote a question?
Thanks!
Oh my god almost every longboarder I've seen on campus acts like such an ass. I can't stand 'em. They're all over the sidewalk, barely dodging people... it's terrible.
I'm a loaded fanboy, I'm not ashamed though, they make great boards, I've got the Ceviche and the dervish sama. You?
Also, the school is relatively flat,  but there are some small inclines.  But those get really crowded during passing time so I take the long and less traveled routes to class. Just be curtious to pedestrians and nobody really cares 
Judging by the comments it doesn't seem to be a very well-known group. Maybe just a facebook group? I don't have a facebook.
A lot of people dislike longboarders here because they don't use any courtesy. Most just fly around weaving through (and bumping into) people and don't care.
The was club founded this year I believe.
Well from the comments here I've decided to bring mine, but I'll try my best to stay out of the way!
It's there, there's also one in Grand Rapids that rides together. In the past there has been a fee races. A dash and an endurance one that was at millenium park. I'm pretty sure the group at school is still around. Just check the activity of the Facebook group.
I actually found it my freshman year (i'm now a junior) on the schools organization website link.  They were a pretty big group when i skated with them freshman year.  I haven't been able to do anything with them since however because of school but i know that they all loved to skate and it was a pretty cool group.  You should check them out if you can.

Cool! Thank you!
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'll try to be courteous.
Just stick to the "don't be a dick" rule and you should be ok.
Awesome! I was also looking at getting one of those but it seems incredibly similar to the Dervish Sama.
Again, I don't have a FB.
Ha, no need to be sorry for others' actions. Just don't be like them.
Will do. Thanks!
Yeah, The dorms. the cheap ones. lol hbu?
Oh, well if you decide to get into the dorms, hmu. you seem like a pretty chill roommate.
Cool man, sounds dope.
I think someone should aggregate a list of all the GVSU parody accounts... 

You're probably wondering why I don't do it myself. Well, I'm lazy
The MIP Library is pretty fitting for Grand Valley
there will be a 30 foot fireplace, I'll bring the bear rug. 
Pure gold!
Most of my friends go to different colleges and some of them tell me that GVSU students have a bad rep. One of them said she met the "skankiest of skanks" who went here and others kind of look down on me for going here. I wish I could argue against these points, but honestly most of the time I find myself agreeing that I don't really like my classmates. They tend to be rude, snobby, and think they are much smarter than they actually are (not that I'm ridiculously smart by any means, but they can be condescending). I hate group projects because of this.

I just found this subreddit and looked at the facebook confessions page and it didn't make me feel much better. I was wondering if anyone ever feels the same way? Or if not, I could use some reassurance. I'm a history major and anthro minor so maybe it's just the field I'm in or something...
Everything you mentioned could also be said of other colleges.  There will be sluts, snobs, and douches at every school.  This isn't exclusive to GVSU.
Never. Our school is up and coming, the only people that tend to give me shit are my friends at MSU and UofM. But ever since my group of friends turned 21, when they visit me in Grand Rapids they defiantly sing another song. 
Yeah, I get that a lot to be honest. Fuck 'em. I came here looking to transfer ASAP, but I've decided to stay. There's good communities here, you just have to find them. The same can be said of professors, administrators, etc. 

Also, there's a 95% chance my student org is bringing in Neil DeGrasse Tyson this year, and he won't be going to MSU or UofM, or CMU or anything like that. So, eat a dick everyone else. 
The facebook confessions page is a crock of shit; it's generalities pandering in faux-satire and over the top bull shit. 
All schools in Michigan have some sort of stereotype associated with them, and we're no different. However, it's nothing to lose sleep over. 

The following are stereotypes associated with different Michigan universities that I've **heard** over the years: 

* University of Michigan = Asian/Smart 
* Michigan State University = Hicks/Dumb 
* GVSU = Snobby/Wealthy/White 
* WMU = Bros/Gross/Not smart enough for GVSU/UM  
* CMU = Jersey Shore/Drama/Not smart enough for GVSU/UM 

I'm not saying that I agree with the aforementioned stereotypes, but from my experiences, I'm not saying I disagree with all of them... 

You're going to run in to dumb classmates at any university. 

I'd rather have our widely-known stereotype than some of the stereotypes associated with the other universities... 

And no, I've never been embarrassed about matriculating here - In fact, I'm proud of it 
Absolutely not, I love Grand Valley. I have always felt that it positively defined who I am now. The relationships that I had with professors and alumni of my program while in undergrad were incredible. Don't let your friends get you down, GV is a great place. 
Back when I was at GV (grad in 2010) I remember being in a small group in a Comm class and the other 4 people were bragging about how they had MIPs. I remember thinking, "WTF, why are you proud of irresponsibility?"
Nope. Got my degree here in 2010. Recently, one of my neighbor's snotty little girls considered GVSU to be a person's "backup" school- when back when I attended, Central or Eastern were considered "backups". You can say that about any school- and honestly, the skankiest women I've known have always seemed to attend MSU or Central. 
As a Chip, yeah I would be embarassed. Nothing but fags and fuck faces at GVSU. But I have met some really sweet and nice girls there. And for the skankiest of the skanks thats Western. Fuck the broncos. Fire up Chips.
It is a money thing. I got the same shit when I was at gvsu 15 years ago. But I think my education was better. Smaller classes, profs you can actually talk to. Smaller campus. It is a great school.
I heard about that and I am pumped if we do get him.  Thanks for helping on that 
Are you guys teaming-up with the GR CFI, or is the GVSU CFI bringing him in alone? 

Very impressed. 

EDIT: I also heard what his speaking fee is...and still think he's worth it 
Prepare to be lurked.
Sorry you couldn't get into a better university.
I always joke that we're all going to be equally unemployed anyways but I'll have less debt.
I didn't explain the money thing: students often equate more expensive with better. That isn't the case.
Yeah that's one of the problems as well. A lot of people write off GVSU as cheap. :/
As an alum, this excites me and I hope it is open to all of us.
We've cosponsored, but he will be coming to GVSU itself only. 
Hey Matt. Likewise. 
Also a Chip, can confirm that I will be transferring here soon. CMU blows so much dick
No joke. I paid mine off. My friends who went to bigger schools haven't.
Events/speakers/etc... that the school pays for are open to everyone 
I just went and approved a bunch of posts... my bad everyone.

Open debate about what between whom where?
Whats the point of this?
Aside from half these questions having next to nothing to do with debate at all, you’ve given no explanation as to why this was posted.
You should have really worded this far better dude. Open debate isn't a good term because there's 3 seperate styles inside open debate. Open just refers to the league status anyways, doesn't it? Like there's the newbie level and then open/varsity? 

Are you talking about competitive policy debate? If so you need a backing of coaches and professors and is the only decent form of debate anyways
Open debate as a general concept where you have any topic.

You already have all of my things!!!
Who the hell are you!?
This really is a fun game. *leaps away*
why are we not allowed to go home?
To not spread the virus to your home?
Well we are allowed to go home, it just costs about $5 or so now.
if we get tested before we go why would in matter
wait what?
Because you could get sick at home and bring it back
thats about the cost of a 'pigs in a blanket' bumper sticker id imagine, just slap that baby on and peacefully protest your way back home.
so then get tested before you go back too. not that difficult
Results can take 2-3 days and the incubation period can be more than a week. Really not hard to grasp
False negatives are a thing
You think people are actually gonna do that
So I'm wondering about about the fridge size of the Laker Village Single Room efficiency apartment and how big the fridge is in the apartment and if I could use a mini fridge there as well.
I never stayed in LV so take my answer with a grain of salt...I lived in South E one year and we had a full-size refrigerator, my rough guess would be that LV has the same but I'm not sure. You should be able to call Housing and ask them. As for a mini, I believe housing policy asks that you do not bring one if your unit already has a full size in the kitchen. That being said, I don't think they strongly enforce that, if you really need some additional cold space.
With 600 cases and a student/faculty/staff population of around 30,000, that puts the total case rate around 2%. The case rate for Kent County (about 9200 cases and 656,000 residents) is about 1.5%. I think this might be a bit dramatic.

That being said, the tuition argument is completely valid in my opinion. Increasing tuition while your entire student body is receiving a fraction of the services/amenities at a fraction of the quality that could be reasonably expected by a student at GV is absurd.
Those demands are a bit outrageous! GIVE US A FULL REFUND AND A PLACE TO LIVE AND HEALTHCARE AND FOOD. wtf? how are they going to give you a refund AND housing, food and healthcare?? what do you think, that money grows on tress?
I cringed at
> Well 'Philly'
Yeah this is pretty ridiculous. If you don’t like what’s going on then don’t take classes this semester?
Excellent!! So proud of our students!!! We support you!!!
Well it was a freshman 🤦🤦🤦
to be fair, classes have been in session just shy of a month, while Kent has been recording their cases since March.
Completely agree. This "petition" is DOA.
Seriously, whoever wrote this just wants a bunch of free handouts. Since when is a University responsible for healthcare to students? Finding shelter for students not on campus? 

Petitions can be great and all but this one is ludicrous. Horribly written and sounds more like someone whining rather than asking for change. ffs they called for the presidents job!
With a $133,000,000 endowment it can’t be that ridiculous.
Agreed, they think they can just drain the endowment fund and call it good. Yeah that is not how this works, probably a freshman who is pissed they cant have a fun welcome week.
Either way you look at it it's not enough justification to pull the plug. It's perfectly reasonable to try to slow community spread through other means before dropping the nuclear option imo.
As we all know, endowments are stored in the cave under zumbridge hall. It is the sole responsibility of each president to guard this horde with their life. Mantella sleeps each night on this mountain of cash, spooning with her m249.

It will be hard fought, but if we work together we can retake the cave and all share in the spoils.
Yes. I also think there’s a pretty heavy amount of the university population fine with being in person, they’re just a lot less vocal about it.
Hi guys. I know Lakers are amazing and supportive, so I'm hoping you can help. My cousin Mike, a former Laker, has been nominated for a national contest for the NMEDA's Local Heroes contest to win his first wheelchair accessible vehicle. Mike studied computer science at GVSU and has been super involved with the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship.

Mike is 25 years old and was born with cerebral palsy. He is capable of driving his own vehicle, but requires one with accessibility features. He has faced many obstacles, financial and otherwise, trying to gain his independence. He is a former Grand Valley student (Go Lakers!) and now has the opportunity to become a computer programmer for a local GR company, but having reliable transportation would be a huge first step in making this dream a reality.

You can vote and read more about his story at his entrant profile here:

http://www.mobilityawarenessmonth.com/entrant/mike-knooihuisen-walker-mi/

You can vote daily, twice if you answer the daily trivia question correctly. If you want to take an extra step, share this post to your friends and family. Thank you for your support, Lakers! It means a lot!
Thanks everyone!

Let’s figure out a time and place and try to spread the word on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Masks required, and probably on the downtown campus. GVSU should NOT be resuming in-person classes. This is absolutely abhorrent.
If anyone is a freshmen go into the fb group page for them and go and convince people to take gap years because they won't get their full college experience and the school doesn't care about your safety, well being, providing a good experience, etc. Only care about their pr and not you and us the students. If we get a ton of people to drop their tuition and classes and housing then we will see real blowback and change from the school
Probably not the best idea, because even if we wear masks and distance we will probably all die.
How about masks not required, but alcohol is. You do understand that this is all just an arrogant pr move for them. If we make the school look bad then we will get what we want, or at least they will lose money and get hurt from us rebelling.
Lmaooo let’s be friends
Lmaooo let’s be friends
Even if we save just 1 life by not protesting its worth it.
I feel you but the administration is looking for any reason to push blame on students. If there is a protest, it needs to be by the books. Masks, outdoors, and social distanced as much as possible.
Go suck a dick dude. Nobody is going to fucking die you dumbass. Besides I want my room and board money refunded with me being able to definitely be able to take classes at home and with me still having a place to come back too next semester if we have irl classes then
What happens if the blame is pushed on the students because odds are that is what's going to happen anyways? Other then a oh we're disappointed in our students email or some shit what can they do? Hell what is a protest that is social distanced even going to do anyways? Do you really think that is what intimidates or scares them? The reason people protest is to intimidate or scare people to then force them to change to the will of the crowd. I promise you a timid protest isn't going to do shit. Anything less then pure pr destruction even if it means students gets blamed is the only way we can actually force their hand.
Exactly, no one is going to die. Thats why its perfectly fine to have in person classes with masks+distancing.

edit: in fact your reply is so perfect, anyone who doesnt suspect you are my second account is an idiot lmao
Class inside

Safe from virus outside
fuck you bitch I just want to save money from not having to live in allendale, or being able to workout
Its just a bit strange you believe no one is going to die, and yet you believe we should be 100% online because of covid. 

Also we are still within the room and board refund deadline btw, you can still cancel at no cost.

Not really sure what your argument is, you kind of just seem like a typical room temp IQ troll.
I need a place to stay for winter semester in case of irl classes then. I don't care about covid whatsoever. I care about getting my classes done and graduating this year, as well as saving money due to being able to safely getting refunded my room and board
Thanks for forcing the university to waste my tuition dollars on a stupid lawsuit, assholes. 
The 0.03 percent of campus is a dumb argument.

.03% of campus is a lot when you consider the empty space of campus as well as the foot traffic by kirkhof and au sable.

I wonder if the percentage takes all the undeveloped land owned by GV into account.
LOL, without the slightest hint of irony the university said in a statement: "Grand Valley State University embraces the First Amendment and encourages, supports and defends free speech."
When it comes to the case law and constitutional law involving the issue, it is clearly illegal for public universities to restrict free speech *anywhere* outdoors on campus, as long as students are not blocking doorways or being so loud that they're disrupting classes.

That was the precedent clearly set by numerous cases at universities like UNC Greensboro, West Virginia University, Texas Tech, and the University of Cincinnati. [Read this article for more information.](https://www.thefire.org/federal-court-university-of-cincinnati-free-speech-zone-violates-first-amendment-cannot-stand-3/)

Moreover, the fact that the faculty, campus administrators, etc. didn't enforce the rules equally - they allowed left-wing groups to demonstrate on campus outside of the Orwellian "free speech" zones while shutting down peaceful conservative or libertarian activists - *highlights the core of the issue*.

When you have unfair and unconstitutional rules like this set by a government entity (in this case a public university), the political establishment (in this case the university administrators) can choose to ignore the rules when causes they support break them. This clearly creates an environment where some causes can be discriminated against while others are allowed to do whatever they like on campus. Clearly, that's exactly what's happening at GVSU now, since the anti-Trump, pro-abortion, and BLM protesters were allowed to flagrantly violate campus policy without repercussion.

Now I want you to ask yourself - if the tables were flipped, and the GVSU administration allowed conservative and libertarian activists to hold demonstrations *anywhere* on campus while limiting left-wing activists to a tiny portion of campus, would you still be defending this illegal, unfair, and unconstitutional rules?
I just want to clarify that I definitely have a left wing bias and disagree with the group's message but I don't believe that disqualifies this opinion as I tried my hardest to keep it unbiased and it mainly focuses on the law and campus rules.

> the fact that the faculty, campus administrators, etc. didn't enforce the rules equally - they allowed left-wing groups to demonstrate on campus outside of the Orwellian "free speech" zones while shutting down peaceful conservative or libertarian activists - highlights the core of the issue.

I said a few things along these lines in my earlier post, the article didn't show any example of leftwing groups being favored it just mentioned a Donald Trump protest. I'm under the impression that the Turning Point group is not protesting but is instead trying to recruit/spread their message. Groups attempting to do this must remain in certain zones where as the left wing protest i've seen have been protests that (I'm assuming made plans with the university) are marching around campus.

I think the distinction the University is making is between a protest/march and an organization trying to recruit people. The article wasn't very clear and I was only responding to that source so if someone has links to more information that could prove that this isn't the case I would appreciate it. If the Turning Point group asked to march/protest on campus and were refused I would definitely see them winning a case, unless the university had a legitimate concern. 


**this is from the article linked to in the comment above**

> Prior to today’s court order, UC had required all “demonstrations, pickets, and rallies” to be held in a “Free Speech Area” that comprises just 0.1% of the university’s 137-acre West Campus. University policy further required that all expressive activity in the free speech zone be registered with the university a full ten working days in advance, threatening that “[a]nyone violating this policy may be charged with trespassing.”

UC's "Free Speech Area" applied to protesters, not people recruiting for their organization. This is different from GV's Free Speech Area as it prevents recruitment by greek life, clubs, sports teams, churches, political groups, etc. all over campus and confines it to specific areas that receive a high volume of student traffic. It is not confining protesters which would violate the law in my opinion. 

> ask yourself - if the tables were flipped, and the GVSU administration allowed conservative and libertarian activists to hold demonstrations anywhere on campus while limiting left-wing activists to a tiny portion of campus, would you still be defending this illegal, unfair, and unconstitutional rules

I don't believe the groups were being discriminated based on political ideology and I also don't believe that the rules are illegal, unfair and unconstitutional. If this article could show that the university cared about the political ideologies of the groups then I would be all for the lawsuit and be on the side of Turning Point. 
Also I want to make it 100% clear that, even though I'm on the left, that my political views aren't influencing my view on this lawsuit it's simply argued from the perspective of what the rules actually are and if those rules are unfair. 
Less than $200?
Don’t use crytal clean they don’t do a good job
Some friends of mine told me about this "protest" so, naturally I tagged along to check it out just for the heck of it. We got there about ten minutes before the crowd came, so we got front row in front of the camera.....Now I am in a video of this huge "story," that escalated quickly to national news. I don't know if I like that much attention.  I just hope they re-install the ball because of how fast this has escalated.
Sometimes I'm embarrassed to be a student here.
I think we should all meet and play games again. Any one up for a hangout night?

Let me know if you find anything broken with it, or have any suggestions.

Edit: Also, let me know if you like it, of course! I'm hoping more and more people will actually use it, as it could turn into a very powerful software that I could market to climbing gyms.
This is great as a new member of Vertical Earth I can't wait to use this!
This is a great idea that would be far better suited as a smartphone app. There are a ton of routes up and it would e difficult to remeber all of the data without writing it down if you climb for 4-5 hours as I used to. 

Also, it's pretty amazing how much has changed at the climbing center. I used to set routes for comps there along with a few friends  I don't recognize a single name on that list whereas 6 or 7 years ago I would have known everyone on it. 
Yeah, I'm working on a mobile version of it. Glad to hear some positive feedback!

The setting here currently is, well, unique. Very hit or miss. I'd like to think that I'm a decent setter, haha.
Mobile version is complete. It should automatically redirect you if you're using a smartphone.
Looks good!
So there are tons of bigger and cheaper universities in Michigan, so why would a student come to GVSU? Why did you? Serious question - I did several <university> is best known for what searches and GVSU doesn't seem to be known for, well, anything. So why should I come here?

edit: I'm actually quite interested in GVSU, the comments by DerzKing, Code_Moo, and GoldenJ make it sound like it's a great place to learn without feeling like a faceless number. Thanks for the great feedback!
Don't. Clearly you don't want to and if all you're concerned about is what list GVSU is ranked highest on, you're going to miss out on those small things that make GV special. 
I'm a prof. I have never seen a public university with these kind of resources this dedicated to teaching and to undergraduates. There are other great choices, I'm an MSU grad, but we're unique. The profs at most schools are about the research, and it can be unusual to find one dedicated to teaching. Profs here are scholars, but often working on UG accessible research, and everyone is committed to teaching. It's like Williams or Benoit with the resources of 20K+ students.
What helped me make my choice was that Grand Valley is mostly undergraduate only. So, as a chemistry major this meant I didn’t have to compete with graduate students for research projects and professors here have more of an emphasis on teaching rather than getting that next grant for their research. Other reasons are the fact that it’s a moderately small school where I can see someone if I want to, but it’s also big enough to where I can blend in with the crowd. It’s also beautiful! Compared to many other university campuses it’s very clean and well put together. 
Alumni of the biomedical sciences program here. 

Campus: Of all the university campuses I've been on in the state, GVSU's had by far the nicest campus with the most modern, updated buildings. I live in Ann Arbor and constantly hear my friends complain about the old, run-down dorms/ classrooms at UM. But being 15 mins from the beach and 15 mins from GR is very nice as well.

Curriculum: I basically had no gen eds to take and there are fewer required useless classes compared to other schools. There were lots of options for upper level courses not offered at other universities, like cadaver dissections, which is extremely rare for any university to offer this to undergrads. 

Class size: An underrated feature. My friends at places like UM or MSU complain constantly about their huge science lectures with 200-400 students. They also have to deal with GSIs and TAs doing a lot of the discussions/grading/office hours. Although GVSU is the 3rd largest school in the state, I often had science lectures of 20-40 people, the largest class being about 100. These were taught exclusively by qualified professors, along with the discussion section, and the professors were very available in office hours. I may have gotten lucky with profs though.
Tons bigger? Only Michigan State, Michigan, Wayne State, and possibly Central Michigan are bigger. 
West Michigan is an amazing area. I feel like I am getting a really good quality of education here. The facilities are modern and clean, and I feel like a lot of the professors truly give a damn about their students
Was waitlisted at Michigan tbh... 
If you want a job out of the Midwest, don't go here because in my experiences it has been really hard. Finally landed an IT position in Texas though so it is possible. U of M and MSU open a shit ton more doors in that regard.
I'm a transfer student, so I don't have the same experience as others do. I can tell you though, GVSU advisors are so much better than the ones at the community college I went to. People here are abit aloof, but nice, something that GR tends to do, in my experience. The classes are good, I don't think I've had one with more than 40 students yet. The professors seem more invested in the students than at other schools my friends go to.


The best institution for you is the one that best fits YOUR needs and aspirations.  Choosing schools based on these standards your given is extremely foolish.  A community college could be the best thing for someone, while Harvard could be the absolute worst thing for them.
Jesus. Why don't you list the "small things that make GV special." This subreddit is full of douchebags. I wouldn't have attended GV if I read shit this. 
The only truth in this thread lol. Same bro.
What most don't realize is GVSU is a teaching institution rather than a research institution.  Research is done here, but that is not the main focus for faculty.  Meaning, if you want to be a faculty member at GVSU, you are coming here to TEACH.  Being an aloof professor who does the walking zombie in pajamas routing through their teaching role are not going to last long here (unless you have tenure).
We don't work for admissions. Look at OP's post...they don't want to attend or aren't convinced they want to attend. GV wasn't my first undergrad school and I didn't want to attend at first either but I spoke with the right person in admissions who helped convince me that GV was the best fit for me and I have loved the school since. If truth makes me sound douchey, so be it. Why don't you list the things that made GV special for you?
Pretty minimal list to be completely honest. 
NULL
If you think for a second you wouldn't get it with your stats, then you're not as smart as your GPA suggests.
Bro, your guaranteed to get accepted 
Pretty slim. I hear that you have to have a 4.2 and a medal of honor and at least be nominated for a nobel prize to have a shot.
I got auto accepted with a 3.6 and a 30 ACT, and then applied and was accepted to the Honors College so you are a lock for both, to be honest.
Dude get your ass to Michigan
Pretty much guaranteed to both the University and the honors college if you're interested in it.
If you are going to apply, you should also apply for the honors college as well. Totally worth it and the dorms are amazing. 
As everybody else has stated you are all but guaranteed to be accepted. And as much as I loved my 5 years at GV I would definitely still recommend that you apply to many universities in order to have as many options as possible.
Yeah you're pretty much guaranteed in. I had around your stats and quickly did their application in late December and barely put any effort into it and got accepted a couple days later and got honors college/scholarship offers. 
Yeah may as well move into a dorm now.
You'll get in and should be able to score scholarships especially if you apply for the honors college
Where else are you applying?
Republicans can also vote in the Republican primary ....
Registered as a MI resident and voter on February 9th... Fuck.
That sucks and I'm sorry to hear. Do you know if your friends and family are registered in the state?
Moved from Illinois, but they all know when they're date is
Pry not
Why is our tuition increasing when the university is clearly generating more than enough money already? I mean, the answer is clear but it’s frustrating that everyone just shrugs it off and accepts that as the way things are especially since this is a public university. American universities don’t have nearly enough checks to keep costs reasonable and its really disheartening that it doesn’t seem like things will change anytime soon.
Absolutely not. Also, she sucks.
I believe you're mistaken. Her salary is 480k according to [published salary information](https://www.gvsu.edu/cms4/asset/8D86E681-E631-FDD9-C965A207536EA137/section_245_-_website.pdf) (page 16). According to the [release today](https://www.gvsu.edu/gvnext/2020/gvsu-boosts-financial-aid-by-13-plans-for-11591.htm), she has pledged 10% (48k) for student aid and the deans have pledged 5%.
No. Her salary is $480k, that’s not 10%.
Why does she suck?
Do you know if that is themselves personally pledging a percentage of their salary? I personally believe that nobody is under any obligation to give away their money. but youd think that someone who is the president of a very liberal university & makes a disgusting amount of money would publicly do so to help students during something like this😂
Oh I read it wrong, that’s still crazy high
I only know what was in that release. It makes it sound that they’re all personally donating. Administrators taking paycuts the year seems to be the trendy thing at many schools. 

We could argue how much money the president and deans should be donating (and there are plenty of overpaid deans). But even if they all donated 100% of their salary, the overall impact is small. I’d much rather push for transparency in their reopening plan and judge the administration on its feasibility.
UMich’s is almost twice that.
You don’t like her because she wears makeup? Dumbass
It's going to be hard to live up to someone like T. Haas who left on such a good note, give her some time.

Nobody takes one look at you either and goes "oh this person must be dumb as rocks", you try to get to know them and give it some time.
Not saying the amounts are justifiable but it probably is justifiable that the President of UMich makes 2x that of GV. Running a major research university is a lot different than running a regional state school IMO
T. Haas also never had to deal with a pandemic. The university is working really hard not to cut any jobs right now too. So...it’s really hard to compare the two.
What was the obsession with T. Haas? I graduated and never got it
More of an appreciation I think because he made himself so easy to approach and personable. Whenever he was on campus you could wave at him, "get a selfie" if he had time and he wouldn't mind if he had time. He also did fun things like go to football games with his wife, they would almost always say hi to the marching band, etc.. Just an all around pretty good guy.
This is not the time to get 40+ emails from profs about what software to download and changes to the syllabus. Let people figure out what they are going to do for their work situations or who will watch their kids. The desire to maintain normalcy in the schedule in the face of something like this is insane.
I think that at least professors need to stop expecting to conduct "live online" classes. Just post video lectures and have assignments turned in through BlackBoard. Stop with all the extra nonsense.
I think they’re struggling as much as the students with everything..
I still haven't gotten any communication from one of my profs. Not even an acknowledgement that this is happening, much less what the class is doing
This is a difficult transition for everyone. Please allow your professors to work through this as best as they are able. The situation is not perfect. I know this isn't perfect but this is uncharted territory we are entering.
It's definitely not fair to the profs either. This is unprecedented and needs more preparation than 4 days
Absolutely no one is happy with this— not the teachers, not the students, not the administrators
To be honest if not now, when? Who knows how long we will be out so the sooner we get started the better.
Also, I really need something to do!
Professor here. That’s what I’m doing. The university is really pushing Blackboard Collaborate, but some students don’t even have Wifi at home and I’m not going to penalize them for it. I refuse to pretend that this is not a catastrophic change.  

As I see it, my job is 1) to give my students whatever sense of stability and normalcy I can, 2) to share whatever knowledge and feedback on the subject matter that I possibly can, and 3) hand out A’s like candy on Halloween. 

Let’s all just survive this and be ready to move forward in the fall.
Yep. I have one that went totally dark and two others that have sent me emails every hour about something changing or something I need to set up on my computer.
Bless your soul. I’m grateful we have some level headed professors around here.
Aight, you seem like a pretty cool guy, please tell me what classes you teach so I can be in the presence of that mustache
I actually said this to my friend when I saw this at the connection a few days ago.
Doge?
No. Wow.
Such cup.
Much dissapoint.
Spoiler Alert!
These cups suck for putting liquor in. It seems to leak through so easy.
Not much money, actually.

I agree with tinydustball. I had a 3.63 before Fall 2020 semester. My semester of Fall 2020 was a 3.4, and I had a few professors were I had to teach myself the material. Why should I pay &13,000 out of my own money, not my parents, to teach myself. If that is the case, I could find a good educational page on the internet such as Khan Academy to learn business, math, accounting, economics, and pretty much any other degree that isn’t specialized like healthcare. Heck you can even learn engineering w/o going to college.
The percentage of students that are shitty is likely equal to the percentage of profs that are shitty. Big surprise. It's all luck, and I think the majority of us are aware that a college education (for about half of students pursuing a degree) is a scam; we're essentially paying big bucks out of pocket for a piece of paper that means nothing compared to work experience.
Wow, what a gross post. The condescension is reeking through this screen.
Dear people who think they’re smarter and better than other people: Fuck off 😊
Unless you're exceptional and can interview/network well, or someone gives you an opportunity, you really do want a degree to get your foot in the door for a STEM job. A lot of employers just ignore non degree holding applicants

But a lot of people do use the "zuckerburg" approach, in which you only go to class when absolutely essential and/or you calculate how much work you can skip on without losing credit in the class. These people have determined their time is better spent learning elsewhere but obviously still want the paper (at least until they hit it big lol).

I'm a cs alumnus and my time at gv was ultimately a waste aside from the paper which just tells my first employer that I'm not a complete goon.
GV needs to reconsider their P/F credit/no credit policy.  Many state universities offer the option to chose P/F AFTER final grades have been posted.  Not the second week into the semester.  Obviously many students GPA have dropped due to various levels of class instruction/organization and having to teach themselves the material.  

One university acknowledge this issue by stating “We understand that this semester has been enormously difficult, in your classes and in your personal lives. For many of you, the cumulative toll and anxiety has been amplified by concern about grades and GPA”. These universities have extend the P/F option for both Fall 20/Winter 21 semesters and allowing this decision to be made AFTER grades are posted. 

Maybe GV just wants more money from students who have to repeat classes to boost their GPA or extend their college education?
Took the words out of my mouth. This is disgusting. Whoever wrote this has serious issues that they should probably get checked out!
just wanna thank you both for giving me hope that my degree will serve its intended purpose, and for helping dispel the idea you dont need a degree for a decent job that won't kill your body.
I'm asking this for a writing project I'm doing, and I would like some people's opinions. This is the easiest way for me to " interview" people at the moment, so names would be helpful for quoting.
I don't really care but man week 9 hit and it's hard paying attention now
Tell em that SlingDong69 does not like online classes!
I’ve enjoyed that the shift to online learning has made it easier for me to be in school whilst working and partaking in other aspects of life, but I miss having face time with teachers, as well as the general environment of being in the classroom with peers.
I can confidently say i've only learned practical applicable material in 2 of my classes this semester, when i should be getting it from all of thw classes i am currently in. Lectures online are great for the most part. Labs online are a flippin joke
Thank you for the responsr
Thank you so much for your response
I took only online in the summer and it was fine but they were short semesters

This semester is getting tough starting this week for me if this is good info to know
It really does help
Still not the latest version :( 
It's a start. I'm content with 36.
Yet Java is still, what, like 15+ iterations behind? People have been coming up to us (IT) about Web software for their Orgo assignments not working becuase of this. Yet still no updates.
For real. Its 5 AM right now so I've given up hope for my 8 AM being canceled, but as a commuter (from Holland) this is the worst I've seen it outside
I have a strong feeling about tomorrow being a snow day / cold day because it'll hit -20/-30 windchill tonight
Classic GVSU. Class canceled 2pm+
Just a friendly reminder: no class is worth your life. Don't risk it if you don't feel it is safe on the roads. Email the prof and let them know, hell all the schools are closed in Holland. 

As an employer, I don't require my employees to show up when the city I live in has a snow day, it becomes optional.
I apologize for the repost, I accidentally posted with live discussion.
Any parties going on this Saturday?
Hi GVPD
None that ik of officer
I'm not a cop lol, I'm moving to Copper beech Saturday and some friends are coming down with me and we're looking for something to do. You can add my snapchat in you don't believe me 😂😂 @Dykhuis21
I suggest you follow some of the gvsu Twitter accounts. There is more activity there and you can find where the parties are easier 
Hey guys, 

I'm looking to sell my two tickets to the LaughFest Bo Burnham performance. I can no longer make it. Tickets are for two seats on the upper balcony, about 4 rows back in the balcony. 

Asking price is $100.

Message or comment.
This isn't Craigslist 
I'm interested, how much were they originally?
Obvi Kid is obvi^
Yeah man, my single post is really cluttering up this very active subreddit. Chill out, it's a public forum. 
Already sold. Sorry dude. Are you cosmo from Milford? 
Nope, just a Seinfeld enthusiast. 
It was only a matter of time before big money started moving west. These people cant possibly be surprised.
Hi there!

Our good moderator [jkahrs595](http://www.reddit.com/r/jkahrs595) got to talking and one thing lead to another and now we have Advice Generators. 

"*What are Advice Generators?*" you may ask. Well, good GVSU redditor, they look like this:

[*Smokes cigarette within 25 feet of building***"I'm a rebel"**](/#freshman)

So! Basically, this is the beginning of us being able to be clever/funny with this subreddit.

Other possible future images/advice generators that I'm making up off of the top of my head:

* Louie the Laker
* T. Haas
* Scumbag department

If you have any suggestions and can provide images, send them my way.

Also: **This thread will be the go-to on how to create advice generators**

Current Generators:

There shouldn't be a * in front of the first line
God I'm tired of that meme format.
Any particular reason why?
Okay, so I get that most of GV's expansion is a result of rich West sideofthestate private funding, but every time a new building is being put up in the name of GV it pumps me up. Maybe one day GVSU will be a name known widely around the country. It already has higher quality programs than a lot of schools, but unfortunately there's just no recognition behind the name.
I am so happy to be graduating out of this construction zone of a school. There has been no letting up in my time here, it's simply a ridiculous amount of 'progress' occurring.

To speak to /u/Fighter_spirit's point, it is my opinion that this recognition can only come after the halt to expansion of facilities. We, as a university, are showing no recognition of standards. What I am getting at here is that as the demand for universities increase there needs to be certain checks on university expansion. There can be no recognition developing when we admit more and more kids every year proving a lack, or compromising of standards.
The primary function of a public university is to serve its community 
Definitely can't argue with a general statement like that. My concerns lie in the methods of which we are currently serving this community. I am not well versed enough to call myself an expert in the dynamics which are at play here. What I do know is that current trends, and norms of this university's culture are not cohesive.
im a 21 F I'm going into my senior year at gvsu i live in meadows in allendale and as pathetic as it sounds i have no friends ive had friends come and go some transferred a lot got into relationships others moved down town and we got detached I'm not weird i party i smoke I'm really chill but i find it so hard to make friends at gv and it makes me hate it there everyone seems to have their set group of friends so its hard to fit in anywhere i haven't even been able to go out down town in gr since I've turned 21 bc i have no one to go with so if anyone is willing to hang out let me know
Gv is a hard place to meet people if you didn't get an in freshman year. 
I'll share the post with a couple friends of mine. I've graduated. 
I'm a junior transfer this year and don't know that many people. Let's be friends maybe?
I know a bit on how you feel (though a 26 m). I live off campus though on the east side of GR, but I am willing to meet new people. 
Hey I'm going there on the 24th hit me up on here for my number or email. I need friends as a transfer student lol
I'm not a student but I do live in the area (23/m). There are tons of things to do in the area, including a lot of non-gvsu groups. Do you have any hobbies or interests?

Otherwise feel free to shoot me a message if your specifically looking for people to hang out with.
Have you joined any clubs? Or even made your own? You can go to shows downtown at the Pyramid Scheme or Founders or something. That will get you out of the "daddy paid for my tuition" culture. 

I think it's just a matter of throwing yourself out there. If you see someone that looks interesting, introduce yourself. The worst that could happen is they won't be your friend, which the eact position you're in now. 
Awkwardly returning to the week old thread- sounds like we have quite a few Redditors.  You guys wanna meet Welcome Week at Mully's or something?
Talk to people.
I'm a senior living in 48 west. We will probably have a party or two welcome week that you could come to. Inbox me
I'd like to think that, considering you're a redditor, you'd fit right in with any of my friends (20 M).  And welcome week is gonna be a helluva time.  Inbox me
I mean we're all sophomores so probably a little young for you but we live in meadows too.
What is your major? I am a 24 Female senior in the Illustration program and I am always down to make new friends. I transferred to GVSU a few years a go, so I totally understand your situation. 
Im a senior and I just moved down town. Might even have some people over tonight if you wanted to stop by
this is how i feel exactly and i have a horrible story i went in blind and ended up with a girl from the sag nasty that was very under privileged and ended up not being able to afford school and leaving first semester and then i moved i with someone who didn't allow others in the room all the while being misplaced in the honor dorms i made no friends it was awful i just want to have friends for my senior year 
yes lets!
that you for the words of encouragement I'm deff going to try my hardest this year to put myself out there and i hope everything works out for the best i just turned 21 so I'm excited to hit the down town area but i wouldn't want to go out alone clubs is a good point i think i should really try
I think this is the best way to do it. Just introduce yourself. It is hard for some people to get over that social anxiety, but I feel like there is plenty of opportunities on and off campus to meet people. 

I am a transfer student coming in this year so I am in the same boat. Feel free to message me and we can exchange snaps or emails or something. 
omg this should happen!
why not?!
im majoring in exercise science. and thats really cool i have a lot of friends that go to school for graphic design and stuff we deff need to meet up id love to see ur art!
im not up there yet! I'm taking a class at oakland and it doesn't nd till the 25th so ill b up after that
Probably just related to living on campus. Most people meet their immediate "friend group" via the dorm building that they go into their first year.


Just easier to be "friends" with people that you're forced to be around, especially with how a lot of people have their doors open all day, compared to if you live in an apartment you're kind of limited in the amount of people you see everyday
Trade instagram or snapchat?

Same situation as this guy, welcome week we should chill. The more friends the better
I'm a junior who commutes from home but doesn't have many friends at school, can I get in here, too?
I'd still be down!  Anybody free?
Oh nice! Any particular career goals? 
And for sure! Do you have a facebook?
I would add that it depends on how much you put yourself out there. If you join any kind of campus club/organization that helps because it gets your foot in the door. A lot of the GV population, at least from my experience, finds their friend group and doesn't venture far from it.

I need a reason to go into Zumberge just so I can check out all the new stuff. 
Just go over and walk through some time. The transformation on the inside is incredible, especially if you remember what the old library was like.
